`~sunpy.util.MetaDict` now saves a copy of the metadata on creation, which can
be accessed using the `~sunpy.util.MetaDict.original_meta` property. Three
new properties have also been added to query any changes that have been made
to metadata:

- `~sunpy.util.MetaDict.added_items`
- `~sunpy.util.MetaDict.removed_items`
- `~sunpy.util.MetaDict.modified_items`

As an example, ``my_map.meta.modified_items`` will return a dictionary mapping
keys to their original value and current value.
