Several `sunpy.map.GenericMap` attributes have been updated to return `None`
when the relevant piece of FITS metadata is missing. These are:

- `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.exposure_time`, previously defaulted to zero seconds.
- `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.measurement`, previously defaulted to zero.
- `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.waveunit`, previously defaulted to ``u.one``.
- `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.wavelength`, previously defaulted to zero.
