The callback functions provided to
`~sunpy.visualization.animator.BaseFuncAnimator` ``button_func`` keyword
argument now take two positional arguments rather than one. The function
signature is now ``(animator, event)`` where the first arg is the animator
object, and the second is the matplotlib mouse event.
