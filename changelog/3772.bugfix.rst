Fixed a bug with the calculation of Carrington longitude as seen from Earth where it was using an old approach instead of the current approach (for example, the varying Sun-Earth distance is now taken into account).
The old approach resulted in errors no greater than 7 arcseconds in Carrington longitude when using `~sunpy.coordinates.sun.L0` and `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliographicCarrington`.
