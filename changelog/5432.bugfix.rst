:meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.plot` no longer adds a unit string to the axis
labels if the axes being plotted on is a WCSAxes. For a WCSAxes, angular units
are indicated in the tick labels, and automatically change when the zoom level
changes from e.g. degrees to arc-minutes. This could previously lead to
situations where the axis label units were incorrect.
