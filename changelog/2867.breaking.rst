axis_ranges kwarg of `sunpy.visualization.animator.base.ArrayAnimator`, `sunpy.visualization.animator.image.ImageAnimator` and `sunpy.visualization.animator.line.LineAnimator` now must be entered as None, [min, max] or pixel edges of each array element. Previously, pixel centers were expected.  This change removes ambiguity in interpretation and ensures the extent of the plot can always be accurately derived.
