Enhanced :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_limb` so that the solar limb can be plotted on axes that correspond to a different map (e.g., with a different observer).
The part of the limb that is not visible to the axes's observer because it is on the far side of the Sun is shown as dotted rather than solid.
