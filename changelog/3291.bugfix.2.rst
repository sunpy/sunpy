Fixed a bug where the transformation from `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Helioprojective` to `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Heliocentric` used the Sun-observer distance from the wrong frame when shifting the origin, and thus might not give the correct answer if the observer was not the same for the two frames.
