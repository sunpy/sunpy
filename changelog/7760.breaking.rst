:meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.contour` now uses ContourPy instead of scikit-image for improved performance and consistency with :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_contours`.

This does mean that both that the returned contours may differ in order and values compared to the scikit-image version and as that additional keyword arguments are passed through to the underlying function, specific keyword arguments may no longer be supported with ContourPy.
