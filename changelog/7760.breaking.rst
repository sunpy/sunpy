ContourPy support has been added to :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.contour` for improved performance and consistency with :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_contours`.
Note that ContourPy may produce different contour results and may not support all scikit-image keyword arguments.

This is not the default behaviour, but will be in the future.

:meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.contour` now takes a "method" keyword which will raise a deprecation warning if you use scikit-image.
