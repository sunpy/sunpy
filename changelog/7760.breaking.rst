ContourPy is added to :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.contour` for improved performance and consistency with :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_contours`.
You can now choose between ContourPy and scikit-image using the ``library`` keyword argument.
Note that ContourPy may produce different contour results and may not support all scikit-image keyword arguments.
