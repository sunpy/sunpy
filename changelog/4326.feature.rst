`sunpy.timeseries.RHESSISummaryTimeSeries.peek()` has had the following minor
changes:

- The default matplotlib color cycle is now used
- The default matplotlib linewidth is now used
- It is now possible to pass in a user specified linewidth
- Seconds have been added to the x-axis labels (previously it was just hours and minutes)
