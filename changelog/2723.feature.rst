Persist the name of a coordinate, i.e. "earth" even though a concrete
coordinate object has been calculated and use this string representation to change
the way the sunpy frames are printed. This is primarily to facilitate displaying
the name of the body rather than the concrete coordinate when printing a
`SkyCoord`.
