Data products from `~sunpy.net.dataretriever.NOAAIndicesClient` and
`~sunpy.net.dataretriever.NOAAPredictClient` have been updated to download
new JSON files. The old text files which the data used to come in no longer
exist.

Both `sunpy.timseries.sources.NOAAIndicesTimeSeries` and
`sunpy.timseries.sources.NOAAPredictIndicesTimeSeries` have been updated to
support the new JSON files. Loading the old text files is still supported,
but support for this will be removed in a future version of sunpy.
