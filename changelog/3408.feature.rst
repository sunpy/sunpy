The returned list of `sunpy.map.Map` objects is now sorted by filename when passing a
directory or glob pattern to `sunpy.map.MapFactory`. Single character wildcards and
character ranges can now also be used as glob patterns. `sunpy.map.Map` also now accepts
`pathlib.Path` objects, in addition to `str`, when passing a file system path.
