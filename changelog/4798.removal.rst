:meth:`sunpy.net.vso.VSOClient.search` has a new keyword argument
``response_type=`` which controls the return type from the ``search()`` method.
In sunpy 2.1 and 3.0 it will default to the ``"legacy"`` response format, in
3.1 it will default to the new ``"table"`` response format, and the
``"legacy"`` format may be deprecated and removed at a later date.

Searches made with ``Fido`` will use the new ``"table"`` response format, so
this only affects users interacting with the ``VSOClient`` object directly.
