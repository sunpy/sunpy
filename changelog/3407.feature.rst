`sunpy.visualization.animator.ArrayAnimatorWCS` was added which uses the WCS
object to get the coordinates of all axes, including the slider labels. It also provides the
ability to customise the plot by specifying arguments to
`~astropy.visualization.wcsaxes.WCSAxes` methods and supports animation of
WCS aware line plots with Astroy 4.0.
