`sunpy.visualization.animator.ArrayAnimatorWCS` was added which uses the WCS
object for all operations, including the slider labels. It also provides the
ability to customise the plot by specifying arguments to
`~astropy.visualization.wcsaxes.WCSAxes` methods and supports animation of
WCS aware line plots with Astroy 4.0.
