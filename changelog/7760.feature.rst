A new method :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.get_contours`, has been added for getting contours.
By default it now uses ContourPy for improved performance and consistency with :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_contours`. By using the "method" keyword, one can change to scikit-image

Note that ContourPy may produce different contour results and may not support all scikit-image keyword arguments.
