The search results object returned from ``Fido.search``
(`~sunpy.net.fido_factory.UnifiedResponse`) now correcly counts all results in
it's `~sunpy.net.fido_factory.UnifiedResponse.file_num` property. Note that
because some ``Fido`` clients now return metadata only results, this is really
the number of records and does not always correspond to the number of files
that would be downloaded.
