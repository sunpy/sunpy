Fido clients (subclasses of `sunpy.net.base_client.BaseClient`) can now register their own attrs modules with `sunpy.net.attrs`.
This allows clients which require attr classes specific to that client to register modules that can be used by the user i.e. ``a.vso``.
It also allows clients implemented externally to sunpy to register attrs.
