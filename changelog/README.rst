.. note::

    This README was adapted from the pytest changelog readme under the terms of the MIT licence.

This directory contains "news fragments" which are short files that contain a small **ReST**-formatted text that will be added to the next ``CHANGELOG``.

The ``CHANGELOG`` will be read by users, so this description should be aimed at SunPy users instead of describing internal changes which are only relevant to the developers.

Make sure to use full sentences with correct case and punctuation, for example::

    Add support for Helioprojective coordinates in `sunpy.coordinates.frames`.

Please try to use Sphinx intersphinx using backticks.

Each file should be named like ``<PULL REQUEST>.<TYPE>.rst``, where ``<PULL REQUEST>`` is a pull request number, and ``<TYPE>`` is one of:

* ``breaking``: A change which requires users to change code and is not backwards compatible. (Not to be used for removal of deprecated features.)
* ``feature``: New user facing features and any new behavior.
* ``bugfix``: Fixes a reported bug.
* ``doc``: Documentation addition or improvement, like rewording an entire session or adding missing docs.
* ``removal``: Feature deprecation and/or feature removal.
* ``trivial``: A change which has no user facing effect or is tiny change.

So for example: ``123.feature.rst``, ``456.bugfix.rst``.

If you are unsure what pull request type to use, don't hesitate to ask in your PR.

Note that the ``towncrier`` tool will automatically reflow your text, so it will work best if you stick to a single paragraph, but multiple sentences and links are OK and encouraged.
You can install ``towncrier`` and then run ``towncrier --draft`` if you want to get a preview of how your change will look in the final release notes.
