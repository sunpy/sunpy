Fixed inconsistencies in how `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.submap` behaves when passed corners in pixel and world coordinates.
The behavior for submaps specified in pixel coordinates is now well-defined for pixels on the boundary of the rectangle
and is consistent for all boundaries. Previously pixels on the lower left boundary were included, but excluded on the
upper and right boundary. This means the shape of a submap may now be 1 pixel larger in each dimension.
Added several more tests for `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.submap` for a range of cutout sizes in both pixel and world
coordinates.
