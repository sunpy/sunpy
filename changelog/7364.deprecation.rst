The keyword ``response_format`` in :meth:`sunpy.net.vso.VSOClient.search` has been deprecated.
This was originally introduced to restore the previous behaviour of the VSO client, which was to return
`sunpy.net.vso.legacy_response.QueryResponse` instead of `sunpy.net.vso.table_response.VSOQueryResponseTable` objects.
This behaviour has been the default for over 4 years and the keyword is no longer needed.
The plan is to remove this keyword and the older `sunpy.net.vso.legacy_response.QueryResponse` class in a future release.
