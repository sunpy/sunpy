``Fido.search`` will now return results from all clients which match a query, you no longer have to make the query specific to a single client. This means that searches involving the 'eve' and 'rhessi' instruments will now potentially also return results from the VSO. For `~sunpy.net.dataretriever.RHESSIClient` you can now specify ``a.Physobs("summary_lightcurve")`` to only include the summary lightcurve data products not provided by the VSO.
