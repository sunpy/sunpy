The keys used to format file paths in ``Fido.fetch`` have changed. They are now
more standardised across all the clients, as they are all extracted from the
names of the columns in the results table.


For results from the VSO the keys are no longer separated with ``.``, and are
the based on the displayed column names, for results from the ``dataretriever``
clients the only main change is that the keys are now lower case, where they
were capitilized before. You can use the `~.UnifiedResponse.path_format_keys`
method to see all the possible keys for a particular search.
