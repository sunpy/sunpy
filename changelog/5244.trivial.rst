Plotting a `~sunpy.map.GenericMap` on a
`~astropy.visualization.wcsaxes.WCSAxes` with a different
World Coordinate System (WCS) to the map now raises a warning,
as the map data axes may not correctly align with the coordinate axes.
This happens if an `~matplotlib.axes.Axes` is created with a projection
that is a different map to the one being plotted.
