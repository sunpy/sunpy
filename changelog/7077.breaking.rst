Rewrote ``~sunpy.net.scraper.Scraper`` functions to use ``parse`` instead of regex and require only a single parse-formatted ``pattern`` variable while creating a Scraper object, instead of the two ``baseurl`` and ``pattern`` variables before.
Removed the ``_extractDateURL()`` and ``_URL_followsPattern()`` methods.
Moved code from ``filelist()`` to a new helper ``_httpfilelist`` function.
Changed the ``~sunpy.net.scraper.TIME_CONVERSIONS`` internal dictionary to be used for parse-format to datetime-format conversions instead of the previous datetime-format to regex conversions.
Created ``~sunpy.net.scraper_utils`` and moved the ``date_floor()``, ``extract_timestep()``, ``check_timerange()`` and ``get_timerange_from_exdict()`` functions from the main scraper class there for better organisation.
Added documentation for writing ``pattern``'s that follow the new format.
The :meth:``~sunpy.net.scraper.Scraper.extract_files_meta`` function no longer requires an extractor pattern.
Added documentation explaining the internal Scraper algorithm to the topic guide on adding new data sources to Fido.
Updated code, documentation and tests for all the clients within ``~sunpy.net.dataretriever`` to work with the new change in the input requirements to the scraper class.
All the extracted timeranges have a millisecond subtracted from the end date, i.e. they end on 59:59:59 of the date just before, instead of the inconsistent issue where some also ended with 00:00:00 of the end date.
