Dataretriever / "Scraper" clients no longer require the regex-formatted ``baseurl`` and a parse-formatted ``pattern`` variable but instead a single and full ``pattern`` variable written in the ``parse``-format.
Documentation about how to write the new patterns and about explaining the internal Scraper algorithm is added to the topic guide on adding new sources to Fido.

The internal method on `~sunpy.net.scraper.Scraper` called ``_extract_files_meta`` function no longer requires an extractor pattern.

A new submodule called ``scraper.net.scraper_utils`` is created and Scraper helper functions like ``date_floor()``, ``extract_timestep()``, ``check_timerange()`` and ``get_timerange_from_exdict()`` can be accessed directly from there.

*All* the extracted timeranges have a millisecond subtracted from the end date, i.e. they end on 59:59:59 of the date just before, instead of the inconsistent issue where some could end with 00:00:00 of the end date which lead to undesirable cases like January 1, 2015 data also showing up in the 2014 year-long timerange.
