All result objects contained within the results of a ``Fido.search()`` (a
`~sunpy.net.fido_factory.UnifiedResponse` object) are now
`~sunpy.net.base_client.QueryResponseTable` objects (or subclasses thereof).
These objects are subclasses of `astropy.table.Table` and can therefore be
filtered and inspected as tabular object, and the modified tables can be passed
to ``Fido.fetch``.

This, while a breaking change for anyone accessing these response objects
directly, will hopefully make working with ``Fido`` search results much easier.
