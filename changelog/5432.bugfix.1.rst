:meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.plot` now correctly sets axis labels based on the
coordinate system of the axes, and not the coordinate system of the map
being plotted. This was previously only an issue if using ``autoalign=True``
when the Map coordinate system was different to the axes coordinate system.
