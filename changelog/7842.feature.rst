Added a FIDO client for retrieving AIA "synoptic" data from the JSOC.
This dataset is not synoptic like HMI and MDI Synoptic images which are images of the solar surface reconstructed from many observations over a solar rotation but rather a synopsis of AIA data.
The AIA synoptic data are calibrated Level 1.5 images with reduced 1k x 1k resolution at regular 2-minute cadence.
