`sunpy.map.GenericMap.wcs` now uses the full FITS header to construct the WCS.
This adds support for instruments with more complex projections, such as WISPR,
however does mean that Map will be more sensative to incorrect or invalid FITS
headers. If you are using custom headers with SunPy Map you might encounter
issues relating to this change.
