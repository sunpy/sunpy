Maps created from :meth:`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.resample` and
:meth:`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.superpixel` have bene fixed in the case where
the resampling was not square, and the PCi_j matrix (often a rotation matrix)
was not a multiple of the identity matrix. When the PCi_j or CDi_j formalisms
are used in the metadata these are now correctly modified, and the CDELT values
are left unchanged.
