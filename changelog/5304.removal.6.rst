Removed various deprecated methods on our Fido clients and responses:

1. ``UnifiedResponse.build_table``, ``UnifiedResponse.tables``, ``UnifiedResponse.responses``, ``UnifiedResponse.get_response`` and ``UnifiedResponse.blocks`` as ``UnifiedResponse`` is now an `astropy.table.Table` that is sliceable.
2. ``UnifiedResponse.response_block_properties`` as ``UnifiedResponse.path_format_keys`` was added as a better replacement.
3. ``HECClient.time_query`` as you can now use ``Fido.search`` directly.
4. ``sunpy.net.jsoc.attrs.Keys`` was not used for querying JSOC.
5. ``sunpy.net.jsoc.JSOCClient.search_metadata`` as the functionality this provided was merged into `sunpy.net.jsoc.JSOCClient.search`.
6. ``sunpy.net.vso.VSOClient.link`` as better search support in the client replaces this method.
