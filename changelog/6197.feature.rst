Three new maps have been added to the sample data from STEREO A and STEREO B at
195 Angstrom, and AIA at 193 Angstrom. These images are from a time when
the three spacecraft were equally spaced around the Sun, and therefore form
near complete instantaneous coverage of the solar surface.

Users upgrading to this version will find this three files download when they
use the sample data for the first time.
