:meth:`sunpy.net.jsoc.JSOCClient.fetch` called `drms` API that passed a ``progress`` keyword which added extra print statements to the console.
This has been removed in `drms` 0.7.0, which had breaking API changes within this release.
As a result, we increased the minimum required version of `drms` to 0.7.0.

This specifically refers to the following information that was printed to the console by default:

``"Export request pending. [id=X, status=X]"``
``"Waiting for X seconds..."``
``"Request not found on server, X retries left."``

These were handled by `drms` and are now logging messages.

If you want to silence these messages, you can set the logging level to ``WARNING`` or higher.

.. code-block:: python

    import logging
    drms_logger = logging.getLogger("drms")
    drms_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)

    from sunpy.net import fido, attrs

Note, you have to do it before you import ``fido``.
