Most of the `sunpy.visualization.animator` subpackage has been removed, with the exception of `~sunpy.visualization.animator.MapSequenceAnimator`
It has been moved into the standalone `mpl-animators <https://pypi.org/project/mpl-animators>`_ package
Please update your imports to replace ``sunpy.visualization.animator`` with ``mpl_animators``.
