`~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliographicCarrington` is now an observer-based frame, where the observer location (specifically, the distance from the Sun) is used to account for light travel time when determining apparent Carrington longitudes.  Coordinate transformations using this frame now require an observer to be specified.
