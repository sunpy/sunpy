Fix a bug in `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.submap` where only the top right and bottom
left coordinates of the input rectangle in world coordinates were considered
when calculating the pixel bounding box. All four corners are once again taken
into account now, meaning that `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.submap` correctly returns
the smallest pixel box which contains all four corners of the input rectangle.
