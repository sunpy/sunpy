Observer-based coordinate frames (`~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Heliocentric` and `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Helioprojective`) no longer assume a default observer (Earth) if no observer is specified.  These frames can now be used with no observer specified, but most transformations cannot be performed for such frames.  This removal of a default observer only affects `sunpy.coordinates`, and has no impact on the default observer in `sunpy.map`.
