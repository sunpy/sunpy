`sunpy.GenericMap.rsun_obs` no longer assumes the observer is at Earth if
 ``rsun_obs`` was not present in the map metadata. The sun-observer
 distance is now taken directly from the observer coordinate. If the observer
 coordinate is not present, this defaults to the Earth, retaining previous
 behaviour.
