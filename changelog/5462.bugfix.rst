The date returned by `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date` for Solar Orbiter/EUI maps
has been adjusted to be taken from the DATE-AVG keyword
(the middle of the image acquisition period), instead of the DATE-OBS
keyword (the beginning of the image acquisition period). This means the observer
coordinate now has the correct date.
