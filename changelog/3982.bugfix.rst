Fixes two bugs in `sunpy.util.decorator.deprecated`: correctly calculates the
removal version and does not override the default and/or alternative functionality
message. Providing a custom deprecation message now suppresses any
mention of the removal version. Additionally, a `pending` keyword argument is
provided to denote functions/classes that are pending deprecation.
