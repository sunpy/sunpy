`~sunpy.net.helio.hec.HECClient` and  `~sunpy.net.hek.hek.HEKClient` now inherit `~sunpy.net.BaseClient` which makes it compatible with ``Fido``.
Added `~sunpy.net.helio.hec.HECResponse` and `~sunpy.net.helio.hec.HECResponse` as container for data returned from ``HEC`` and ``HEK`` searches respectively.
