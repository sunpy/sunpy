Reduced the selection of dependent packages installed by default via ``pip``, which means that some of our sub-packages will not fully import.
You can install all dependencies by specifying ``[all]``, or you can install sub-package-specific dependencies by specifying, e.g., ``[map]`` or ``[timeseries]``.
