Fixed two bugs associated with the handling of WCS ``PVi_m`` values by `~sunpy.map.Map`.
``PVi_m`` values were incorrectly retrieved from the first alternative WCS description (e.g., ``PV1_1A``) instead of the primary WCS description (e.g., ``PV1_1``).
Also, ``PVi_m`` values were misassigned when ``m`` was a two-digit number (i.e., 10 through 99).
