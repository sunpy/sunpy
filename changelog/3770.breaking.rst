The objects returned by the ``search`` methods on ``VSOClient``, ``JSOCClient`` and ``GenericClient`` have been changed to be based on `sunpy.net.base_client.BaseQueryResponse`. This introduces a few subtle breaking changes for people using the client search methods directly (not ``Fido.search``), or people using `sunpy.net.fido_factory.UnifiedResponse.get_response`. When slicing an instance of ``QueryResponse`` it will now return an instance of itself, ``QueryResponse.blocks`` can be used to access the underlying records. Also, the ``.client`` attribute of the response no longer has to be the instance of the class the search was made with, however, it often is.
