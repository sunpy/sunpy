Added automatic conversion of some common but non-standard unit strings in CDF
files to astropy unit objects. If sunpy does not recognise the unit string for
a particular column, units of u.dimensionless_unscaled are applied to that
column and a warning raised. Testing.

If you think a given unit should not be dimensionless and support should be
added for it in sunpy, please raise an issue at
https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues. Test.
