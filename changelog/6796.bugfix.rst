Fixed a bug in ### sunpy/map/mapbase.py file to supply the pixeledges to the ####pcolormesh() function explicitly while calling pcolormesh() function, so it does not treat integer pixels as pixel edges.
When using ``autoalign=True`` when plotting maps, the result was off by half a pixel as the ``pcolormesh`` call was not supplying the pixel edges explicitly.
