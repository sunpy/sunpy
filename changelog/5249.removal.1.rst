Deprecated `sunpy.roi.chaincode.Chaincode` and created a replacement at `sunpy.net.helio.Chaincode`.

This replacement has the following changes:

1. Added support for numpy array as an input (it was broken before).
2. Renamed ``BoundingBox`` to ``boundingbox``
3. Renamed ``subBoundingBox`` to ``sub_boundingbox``
4. Now area and length raise `NotImplementedError`
