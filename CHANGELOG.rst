Sunpy 1.0.0 (2019-06-01)
========================

Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- Move the matplotlib animators from ``sunpy.visualisation.imageanimator`` and
  ``sunpy.visualization.mapcubeanimator`` to `sunpy.visualization.animator`. (`#2515 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2515>`__)
- Make `sunpy.time.parse_time` return `astropy.time.Time` instead of `datetime.datetime`. (`#2611 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2611>`__)
- The properties and methods of `sunpy.time.TimeRange` returns `astropy.time.Time` and `astropy.time.TimeDelta` instead of `datetime.datetime` and `datetime.timedelta` respectively. (`#2638 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2638>`__)
- The `sunpy.instr.goes` module now accepts and returns
  `sunpy.timeseries.XRSTimeSeries` objects only. (`#2666 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2666>`__)
- ``obstime`` keyword param of ``sunpy.instr.goes._goes_lx`` takes a non-scalar `astropy.time.Time` object instead of `numpy.ndarray`. The precision of times contained in `sunpy.timeseries` has been increased to 9 from 6. (`#2676 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2676>`__)
- Removed ``sunpy.net.jsoc.attrs.Time`` because it served the same purpose as `sunpy.net.attrs.Time` after the switch to `astropy.time.Time`. (`#2694 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2694>`__)
- Remove unused ``**kwargs`` within TimeSeries functions. (`#2717 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2717>`__)
- Rotation matrices inside map objects were previously stored as numpy matrices, but are now
  stored as numpy arrays, as numpy will eventually remove their matrix datatype. See
  https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html for more information. (`#2719 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2719>`__)
- The `sunpy.cm.show_colormaps` function now accepts the keyword 'search' instead of 'filter'. (`#2731 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2731>`__)
- The keyword arguments to all client ``.fetch`` methods have been changed to
  support the new parfive downloader and to ensure consisteny across all Fido
  clients. (`#2797 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2797>`__)
- The Helioviewer client has been switched to using the newer Helioviewer API.
  This has meant that we have changed some of the keywords that were passed into client's methods.
  We have enforced that several keywords (observatory,instrument,detector,measurement) need to be defined otherwise the functions cannot return any data. (`#2801 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2801>`__)
- Maps no longer assume that the pixel units are arcseconds if the units aren't
  explicitly set. In addition to this if critical metadata is missing from when
  creating a map, the map will fail to initialize and will raise an error. (`#2847 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2847>`__)
- axis_ranges kwarg of `sunpy.visualization.animator.base.ArrayAnimator`, `sunpy.visualization.animator.image.ImageAnimator` and `sunpy.visualization.animator.line.LineAnimator` now must be entered as None, [min, max] or pixel edges of each array element. Previously, pixel centers were expected.  This change removes ambiguity in interpretation and ensures the extent of the plot can always be accurately derived. (`#2867 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2867>`__)
- All keywords have been added (with defaults) to each `~sunpy.net.helioviewer.HelioviewerClient` function.
  This means that there will be some changes to the style of the PNG screenshot that is returned.
  Returns for the JPEG 2000 and the other functions should be the same but not guaranteed. (`#2883 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2883>`__)
- Changed `sunpy.sun.models.interior` and `sunpy.sun.models.evolution` from `pandas.DataFrame` to `astropy.table.QTable` (`#2936 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2936>`__)
- Minimum numpy version is now >=1.14.5 (`#2954 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2954>`__)
- Removed ``sunpy.time.julian_day``, ``sunpy.time.julian_centuries``, ``sunpy.time.day_of_year``, ``sunpy.time.break_time``, ``sunpy.time.get_day``. (`#2999 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2999>`__)
- Updated the solar values in `sunpy.sun.constants` to IAU 2015 values. (`#3001 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3001>`__)
- Renamed `eccentricity_sunearth_orbit` to `eccentricity_sun_earth_orbit`. (`#3001 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3001>`__)
- Renamed ``sunpy.image.rescale`` to `sunpy.image.resample`. (`#3044 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3044>`__)
- Remove the ``basic_plot`` keyword argument from
  `~sunpy.map.Map.GenericMap.peek`. An example has been added to the gallery
  showing how to make a plot like this. (`#3109 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3109>`__)
- `sunpy.map.GenericMap` will no longer use the key `solar_b0` as a value for heliographic latitude. (`#3115 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3115>`__)
- `sunpy.map.GenericMap` now checks for a complete observer location rather than
  individually defaulting coordinates (lat, lon, distance) to Earth position. If
  any one of the three coordinates is missing from the header the observer will
  be defaulted to Earth and a warning raised. (`#3115 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3115>`__)
- `sunpy.sun.sun` functions have been re-implemented using Astropy for significantly improved accuracy.  Some functions have been removed. (`#3137 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3137>`__)
- All of the functions in `sunpy.sun.sun` and all of the Sun-specific functions in `sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris` have been moved to the new module `sunpy.coordinates.sun`. (`#3163 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3163>`__)

Features
--------

- Change arguments to `sunpy.test` from ``offline=`` and ``online=`` to ``online`` and ``online_only``. This matches the behavior of the figure keyword arguments and comes as a part of a move to using a modified version of the Astropy test runner. (`#1983 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/1983>`__)
- asdf schemas and tags were added for the SunPy coordinate frames and `~sunpy.map.GenericMap` allowing these objects to be saved to and restored from `asdf <https://asdf.readthedocs.io/>`__ files. (`#2366 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2366>`__)
- The images from image tests are now saved in a local folder for easy access. (`#2507 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2507>`__)
- ``sunpy.map.MapCube`` has been renamed to `sunpy.map.MapSequence` to better reflect its use as a collection of map objects. (`#2603 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2603>`__)
- Net search attributes now support tab completion of values and display a table of possible values when printed, to allow easier discoverability of possible search values. (`#2663 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2663>`__)
- Running the figure tests now creates a page showing the differences between
  the expected figures and the figures produced from running the tests. (`#2681 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2681>`__)
- Add support for Dask arrays in `sunpy.map.Map`. The map factory now checks a whitelist
  of array types rather than strictly checking if the array is of type `numpy.ndarray`. (`#2689 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2689>`__)
- Persist the name of a coordinate, i.e. "earth" even though a concrete
  coordinate object has been calculated and use this string representation to change
  the way the sunpy frames are printed. This is primarily to facilitate displaying
  the name of the body rather than the concrete coordinate when printing a
  `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord`. (`#2723 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2723>`__)
- `~sunpy.net.hek.HEKClient.search` now returns an `astropy.table.Table` instead of list of a `dict`. (`#2759 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2759>`__)
- Add a downscaled HMI image to the sample data. (`#2782 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2782>`__)
- Now able to create a `sunpy.map.Map` using an array and a `astropy.wcs.WCS` object. (`#2793 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2793>`__)
- The download manager for `Fido.fetch <sunpy.net.fido_factory.UnifiedDownloader.fetch>` has been replaced with
  `parfive <https://parfive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. This provides advanced
  progress bars, proper handling of overwriting and the ability to retry failed
  downloads. (`#2797 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2797>`__)
- `sunpy.map.GenericMap` can now save out rice compressed FITS files. (`#2826 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2826>`__)
- Now any SunPyDeprecationWarnings will cause an error when using pytest. (`#2830 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2830>`__)
- Added full Tox support for SunPy tests, documentation build and figure tests. (`#2839 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2839>`__)
- Transition the `sunpy.net.vso.VSOClient` from using suds to `zeep <https://python-zeep.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`__ as the SOAP
  library. This is a more actively maintained library, and should provide better
  support for the VSOs https endpoints. This change should have no effect on the
  public API of the `sunpy.net.vso.VSOClient`. (`#2866 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2866>`__)
- Provided access to the Helioviewer header information using `~sunpy.net.helioviewer.HelioviewerClient.get_jp2_header` function. (`#2904 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2904>`__)
- Add a new WSDL URL and port to support SunPy use of VSO instance at SDAC. (`#2912 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2912>`__)

- Add logger messaging system based on `~astropy.logger.AstropyLogger`, cleaned up all warnings, removed all print statements. (`#2980 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2980>`__)
- The function `sunpy.image.coalignment.get_correlation_shifts` now issues an error when the number of dimensions
  are not correct instead of a warning and returning None. (`#2980 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2980>`__)
- The default location of the sunpy sample data has changed to be in the platform
  specific data directory as provided by `appdirs <https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs>`__. (`#2993 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2993>`__)
- Add timeseries support for EVE/ESP level 1 data in `sunpy.timeseries.sources.eve` (`#3032 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3032>`__)
- The default style for Map plots have changed to reflect the changes in Astropy
  3.2. (`#3054 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3054>`__)
- `sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris.get_body_heliographic_stonyhurst` can now account for light travel time when computing the (apparent) body position, as long as the observer location is provided. (`#3055 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3055>`__)
- Added a helper function (`sunpy.map.make_fitswcs_header`) that allows users to create a meta header for custom created `sunpy.map.GenericMap`. (`#3083 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3083>`__)
- Map plotting now accepts the optional keyword `clip_interval` for specifying a percentile interval for clipping.  For example, if the interval (5%, 99%) is specified, the bounds of the z axis are chosen such that the lowest 5% of pixels and the highest 1% of pixels are excluded. (`#3100 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3100>`__)
- The new function `~sunpy.coordinates.get_horizons_coord` enables querying JPL HORIZONS for the locations of a wide range of solar-system bodies, including spacecraft. (`#3113 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3113>`__)

0.8.0
======

New Features
------------

-  Solar differential rotation for maps and submaps included.
-  Solar rotation calculation and mapcube derotation now use sunpy coordinates.
-  Sample data now downloads automatically on import if not available
   and is now pluggable so can be used by affiliated packages. Shortcut
   names have been normalized and all LIGHTCURVE shortcuts have changed
   to TIMESERIES.
-  Calculation of points on an arc of a great circle connecting two
   points on the Sun.
-  Removed ``extract_time`` function from ``sunpy.time`` and also tests
   related to the function from ``sunpy.time.tests``
-  User can now pass a custom time format as an argument inside
   ``sunpy.database.add_from_dir()`` in case the ``date-obs`` metadata
   cannot be read automatically from the files.
-  Add time format used by some SDO HMI FITS keywords
-  Now the ``sunpy.database.tables.display_entries()`` prints an astropy
   table.
-  Additional methods added inside the ``sunpy.database`` class to make
   it easier to display the database contents.
-  Remove unused ``sunpy.visualization.plotting`` module
-  Port the pyana wrapper to Python 3
-  ``Map.peek(basic_plot-True)`` no longer issues warnings
-  Remove the ``sunpy.map.nddata_compat`` module, this makes
   ``Map.data`` and ``Map.meta`` read only.
-  Add a ``NorthOffsetFrame`` class for generating HGS-like coordinate
   systems with a shifted north pole.
-  Remove deprecated ``VSOClient.show`` method.
-  Deprecate ``sunpy.wcs``: ``sunpy.coordinates`` and ``sunpy.map`` now
   provide all that functionality in a more robust manner.
-  Added hdu index in ``sunpy.database.tables.DatabaseEntry`` as a
   column in the table.
-  Removed ``HelioviewerClient`` from the ``sunpy.net`` namespace. It
   should now be imported with
   ``from sunpy.net.helioviewer import HelioviewerClient``.
-  Removed compatibility with standalone ``wcsaxes`` and instead depend
   on the version in astropy 1.3. SunPy now therefore depends on
   astropy>-1.3.
-  Update to ``TimeRange.__repr__``; now includes the qualified name and
   ``id`` of the object.
-  A new ``sunpy.visualization.imageanimator.LineAnimator`` class has
   been added to animate 1D data. This has resulted in API change for
   the ``sunpy.visualization.imageanimator.ImageAnimator`` class. The
   updateimage method has been renamed to update\_plot.
-  Drop support for Python 3.4.
-  SunPy now requires WCSAxes and Map.draw\_grid only works with
   WCSAxes.
-  ``Helioprojective`` and ``HelioCentric`` frames now have an
   ``observer`` attribute which itself is a coordinate object
   (``SkyCoord``) instead of ``B0``, ``L0`` and ``D0`` to describe the
   position of the observer.
-  ``GenericMap.draw_grid`` now uses ``WCSAxes``, it will only work on a
   ``WCSAxes`` plot, this may be less performant than the previous
   implementation.
-  ``GenericMap.world_to_pixel`` and ``GenericMap.pixel_to_world`` now
   accept and return ``SkyCoord`` objects only.
-  ``GenericMap`` has a new property ``observer_coordinate`` which
   returns a ``SkyCoord`` describing the position of the observer.
-  ``GenericMap.submap`` now takes arguments of the form ``bottom_left``
   and ``top_right`` rather than ``range_a`` and ``range_b``. This
   change enables submap to properly handle rotated maps and take input
   in the form of ``SkyCoord`` objects.
-  When referring to physical coordinates ``Pair.x`` has been replaced
   with ``SpatialPair.axis1``. This means values returned by
   ``GenericMap`` now differentiate between physical and pixel
   coordinates.
-  The physical radius of the Sun (length units) is now passed from Map
   into the coordinate frame so a consistent value is used when
   calculating distance to the solar surface in the
   ``HelioprojectiveFrame`` coordinate frame.
-  A new ``sunpy.visualization.imageanimator.ImageAnimatorWCS`` class
   has been added to animate N-Dimensional data with the associated WCS
   object.
-  Moved Docs to docs/ to follow the astropy style
-  Added SunPy specific warnings under util.
-  SunPy coordinate frames can now be transformed to and from Astropy
   coordinate frames
-  The time attribute for SunPy coordinate frames has been renamed from
   ``dateobs`` to ``obstime``
-  Ephemeris calculations with higher accuracy are now available under
   ``sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris``
-  Add support for SunPy coordinates to specify observer as a string of
   a major solar-system body, with the default being Earth. To make
   transformations using an observer specified as a string, ``obstime``
   must be set.
-  Added VSO query result block level caching in the database module.
   This prevents re-downloading of files which have already been
   downloaded. Especially helpful in case of overlapping queries.
-  Change the default representation for the Heliographic Carrington
   frame so Longitude follows the convention of going from 0-360
   degrees.
-  All Clients that are able to search and download data now have a
   uniform API that is `search` and `fetch`. The older functions are
   still there but are deprecated for 0.8.
