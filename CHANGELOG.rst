0.8.0
======

New Features
------------

-  Solar differential rotation for maps and submaps included.
-  Solar rotation calculation and mapcube derotation now use sunpy coordinates.
-  Sample data now downloads automatically on import if not available
   and is now pluggable so can be used by affiliated packages. Shortcut
   names have been normalized and all LIGHTCURVE shortcuts have changed
   to TIMESERIES.
-  Calculation of points on an arc of a great circle connecting two
   points on the Sun.
-  Removed ``extract_time`` function from ``sunpy.time`` and also tests
   related to the function from ``sunpy.time.tests``
-  User can now pass a custom time format as an argument inside
   ``sunpy.database.add_from_dir()`` in case the ``date-obs`` metadata
   cannot be read automatically from the files.
-  Add time format used by some SDO HMI FITS keywords
-  Now the ``sunpy.database.tables.display_entries()`` prints an astropy
   table.
-  Additional methods added inside the ``sunpy.database`` class to make
   it easier to display the database contents.
-  Remove unused ``sunpy.visualization.plotting`` module
-  Port the pyana wrapper to Python 3
-  ``Map.peek(basic_plot-True)`` no longer issues warnings
-  Remove the ``sunpy.map.nddata_compat`` module, this makes
   ``Map.data`` and ``Map.meta`` read only.
-  Add a ``NorthOffsetFrame`` class for generating HGS-like coordinate
   systems with a shifted north pole.
-  Remove deprecated ``VSOClient.show`` method.
-  Deprecate ``sunpy.wcs``: ``sunpy.coordinates`` and ``sunpy.map`` now
   provide all that functionality in a more robust manner.
-  Added hdu index in ``sunpy.database.tables.DatabaseEntry`` as a
   column in the table.
-  Removed ``HelioviewerClient`` from the ``sunpy.net`` namespace. It
   should now be imported with
   ``from sunpy.net.helioviewer import HelioviewerClient``.
-  Removed compatibility with standalone ``wcsaxes`` and instead depend
   on the version in astropy 1.3. SunPy now therefore depends on
   astropy>-1.3.
-  Update to ``TimeRange.__repr__``; now includes the qualified name and
   ``id`` of the object.
-  A new ``sunpy.visualization.imageanimator.LineAnimator`` class has
   been added to animate 1D data. This has resulted in API change for
   the ``sunpy.visualization.imageanimator.ImageAnimator`` class. The
   updateimage method has been renamed to update\_plot.
-  Drop support for Python 3.4.
-  SunPy now requires WCSAxes and Map.draw\_grid only works with
   WCSAxes.
-  ``Helioprojective`` and ``HelioCentric`` frames now have an
   ``observer`` attribute which itself is a coordinate object
   (``SkyCoord``) instead of ``B0``, ``L0`` and ``D0`` to describe the
   position of the observer.
-  ``GenericMap.draw_grid`` now uses ``WCSAxes``, it will only work on a
   ``WCSAxes`` plot, this may be less performant than the previous
   implementation.
-  ``GenericMap.world_to_pixel`` and ``GenericMap.pixel_to_world`` now
   accept and return ``SkyCoord`` objects only.
-  ``GenericMap`` has a new property ``observer_coordinate`` which
   returns a ``SkyCoord`` describing the position of the observer.
-  ``GenericMap.submap`` now takes arguments of the form ``bottom_left``
   and ``top_right`` rather than ``range_a`` and ``range_b``. This
   change enables submap to properly handle rotated maps and take input
   in the form of ``SkyCoord`` objects.
-  When referring to physical coordinates ``Pair.x`` has been replaced
   with ``SpatialPair.axis1``. This means values returned by
   ``GenericMap`` now differentiate between physical and pixel
   coordinates.
-  The physical radius of the Sun (length units) is now passed from Map
   into the coordinate frame so a consistent value is used when
   calculating distance to the solar surface in the
   ``HelioprojectiveFrame`` coordinate frame.
-  A new ``sunpy.visualization.imageanimator.ImageAnimatorWCS`` class
   has been added to animate N-Dimensional data with the associated WCS
   object.
-  Moved Docs to docs/ to follow the astropy style
-  Added SunPy specific warnings under util.
-  SunPy coordinate frames can now be transformed to and from Astropy
   coordinate frames
-  The time attribute for SunPy coordinate frames has been renamed from
   ``dateobs`` to ``obstime``
-  Ephemeris calculations with higher accuracy are now available under
   ``sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris``
-  Add support for SunPy coordinates to specify observer as a string of
   a major solar-system body, with the default being Earth. To make
   transformations using an observer specified as a string, ``obstime``
   must be set.
-  Added VSO query result block level caching in the database module.
   This prevents re-downloading of files which have already been
   downloaded. Especially helpful in case of overlapping queries.
-  Change the default representation for the Heliographic Carrington
   frame so Longitude follows the convention of going from 0-360
   degrees.
-  All Clients that are able to search and download data now have a
   uniform API that is `search` and `fetch`. The older functions are
   still there but are deprecated for 0.8.

   like 'nan' and 'inf'.

-  Update to new EVE data URL
-  Update LogicalLightcurve example in docs
-  Improved InteractiveVSOClient documentation
-  GOESLightCurve now fails politely if no data is avalible.

Known Bugs:

-  sunpy.util.unit\_conversion.to\_angstrom does not work if 'nm' is
   passed in.

0.3.1
=====

-  Bug Fix: Fix a regression in CompositeMap that made contor plots
   fail.
-  Bug Fix: Allow Map() to accept dict as metadata.
-  Bug Fix: Pass arguments from Map() to io.read\_file.

0.3.0
=====

-  Removal of Optional PIL dependancy
-  Parse\_time now looks through nested lists/tuples
-  Draw\_limb and draw\_grid are now implemented on MapCube and
   CompositeMap
-  Caculations for differential roation added
-  mapcube.plot() now runs a mpl animation with optional controls
-  A basic Region of Interest framework now exists under sunpy.roi
-  STEREO COR colour maps have been ported from solarsoft.
-  sunpy.time.timerange has a split() method that divides up a time
   range into n equal parts.
-  Added download progress bar
-  pyfits is depricated in favor of Astropy

spectra:

-  Plotting has been refactorted to use a consistent interface
-  spectra now no-longer inherits from numpy.ndarray instead has a .data
   attribute.

Map: \* map now no-longer inherits from numpy.ndarray instead has a
.data attribute. \* make\_map is deprecated in favor of Map which is a
new factory class \* sunpy.map.Map is now sunpy.map.GenericMap \*
mymap.header is now mymap.meta \* attributes of the map class are now
read only, changes have to be made through map.meta \* new MapMeta class
to replace MapHeader, MapMeta is not returned by sunpy.io \* The
groundwork for GenericMap inherting from astropy.NDData has been done,
there is now a NDDataStandin class to provide basic functionality.

io: \* top level file\_tools improved to be more flexible and support
multiple HDUs \* all functions in sunpy.io now assume mutliple HDUs,
even JP2 ones. \* there is now a way to override the automatic filetype
detection \* Automatic fits file detection improved \* extract\_waveunit
added to io.fits for detection of common ways of storing wavelength unit
in fits files.

-  A major re-work of all interal imports has resulted in a much cleaner
   namespace, i.e. sunpy.util.util is no longer used to import util.
-  Some SOHO and STEREO files were not reading properly due to a
   date\_obs parameter.
-  Sunpy will now read JP2 files without a comment parameter.
-  Memory leak in Crotate patched
-  Callisto: Max gap between files removed

0.2.0
=====

-  Completely re-written plotting routines for most of the core
   datatypes.

-  Improved documentation for much of the code base, including
   re-written installation instructions.
-  New lightcurve object

   -  LYRA support
   -  GOES/XRS support
   -  SDO/EVE support

   -  Added support for LASCO, Yohkoh/XRT maps
   -  A new CompositeMap object for overlaying maps
   -  Resample method
   -  Superpixel method
   -  The addition of the rotate() method for 2D maps.
