Sunpy v2.0.0 (2020-06-12)
=========================

Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- The frames `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliographicStonyhurst` and `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliographicCarrington` now inherit from the new base class `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.BaseHeliographic`.
  This changes means that ``isinstance(frame, HeliographicStonyhurst)`` is no longer ``True`` when ``frame`` is `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliographicCarrington`. (`#3595 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3595>`__)
- `~sunpy.visualization.cm.color_tables.aia_color_table`, `~sunpy.visualization.cm.color_tables.eit_color_table` and `~sunpy.visualization.cm.color_tables.suvi_color_table` now only take `astropy.units` quantities instead of strings. (`#3640 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3640>`__)
- `sunpy.map.Map` is now more strict when the metadata of a map cannot be validated, and
  an error is now thrown instead of a warning if metadata cannot be validated. In order to
  load maps that previously loaded without error you may need to pass ``silence_errors=True``
  to `sunpy.map.Map`. (`#3646 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3646>`__)
- ``Fido.search`` will now return results from all clients which match a query, you no longer have to make the query specific to a single client. This means that searches involving the 'eve' and 'rhessi' instruments will now potentially also return results from the VSO. For `~sunpy.net.dataretriever.RHESSIClient` you can now specify ``a.Physobs("summary_lightcurve")`` to only include the summary lightcurve data products not provided by the VSO. (`#3770 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3770>`__)
- The objects returned by the ``search`` methods on ``VSOClient``, ``JSOCClient`` and ``GenericClient`` have been changed to be based on `sunpy.net.base_client.BaseQueryResponse`. This introduces a few subtle breaking changes for people using the client search methods directly (not ``Fido.search``), or people using `sunpy.net.fido_factory.UnifiedResponse.get_response`. When slicing an instance of ``QueryResponse`` it will now return an instance of itself, ``QueryResponse.blocks`` can be used to access the underlying records. Also, the ``.client`` attribute of the response no longer has to be the instance of the class the search was made with, however, it often is. (`#3770 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3770>`__)
- `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliographicCarrington` is now an observer-based frame, where the observer location (specifically, the distance from the Sun) is used to account for light travel time when determining apparent Carrington longitudes.  Coordinate transformations using this frame now require an observer to be specified. (`#3782 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3782>`__)
- To enable the precise co-alignment of solar images from different observatories, the calculation of Carrington coordinates now ignores the stellar-aberration correction due to observer motion.
  For an Earth observer, this change results in an increase in Carrington longitude of ~20 arcseconds.
  See :ref:`sunpy-coordinates-carrington` for more information. (`#3782 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3782>`__)
- Fixed a bug where some of the coordinate transformations could raise `ValueError` instead of `~astropy.coordinates.ConvertError` when the transformation could not be performed. (`#3894 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3894>`__)
- Astropy 3.2 is now the minimum required version of that dependency. (`#3936 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3936>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Fido search attrs available as `sunpy.net.attrs` i.e, ``a.Time``, ``a.Instrument`` etc are now deprecated as VSO attrs (`sunpy.net.vso.attrs`). (`#3714 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3714>`__)
- `sunpy.util.multimethod.MultiMethod` is deprecated, `functools.singledispatch` provides equivalent functionality in the standard library. (`#3714 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3714>`__)
- `sunpy.net.vso.attrs.Physobs` has been moved to `sunpy.net.attrs.Physobs` and the original deprecated. (`#3877 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3877>`__)
- Deprecate `sunpy.instr.aia.aiaprep` in favor of the `register` function in the
  [aiapy](https://gitlab.com/LMSAL_HUB/aia_hub/aiapy) package.
  `sunpy.instr.aia.aiaprep` will be removed in version 2.1 (`#3960 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3960>`__)
- Removed the module `sunpy.sun.sun`, which was deprecated in version 1.0.
  Use the module `sunpy.coordinates.sun` instead. (`#4014 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4014>`__)
- Removed Sun-associated functions in `sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris`, which were deprecated in 1.0.
  Use the corresponding functions in `sunpy.coordinates.sun`. (`#4014 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4014>`__)
- Remove the deprecated ``sunpy.net.vso.vso.VSOClient`` ``.query_legacy`` and ``.latest`` methods. (`#4109 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4109>`__)
- Removed the sample datasets NOAAINDICES_TIMESERIES and NOAAPREDICT_TIMESERIES because they will invariably be out of date.
  Up-to-date versions of these NOAA indices can be downloaded using `~sunpy.net.Fido` (see :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_gallery_plotting_solar_cycle_example.py`). (`#4169 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4169>`__)


Features
--------

- Added `~sunpy.coordinates.metaframes.RotatedSunFrame` for defining coordinate frames that account for solar rotation. (`#3537 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3537>`__)

- Updated the gallery example titled 'Downloading and plotting an HMI magnetogram' to rotate the HMI magnetogram such that solar North is pointed up. (`#3573 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3573>`__)
- Creates a function named ``sunpy.map.sample_at_coords`` that samples the data from the map at the given set of coordinates. (`#3592 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3592>`__)
- Enabled the discovery of search attributes for each of our clients. (`#3637 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3637>`__)
- Printing `sunpy.net.attr.Instrument` or other "attrs" will show all attributes that exist under the corresponding "attr". (`#3637 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3637>`__)
- Printing `sunpy.net.Fido` will print out all the clients that Fido can use. (`#3637 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3637>`__)
- Updates `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_grid` to allow disabling the axes labels and the ticks on the top and right axes. (`#3673 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3673>`__)
- Creates a ``tables`` property for `~sunpy.net.fido_factory.UnifiedResponse`, which allows to access the `QueryResponse` as an `~astropy.table.Table`, which then can be used for indexing of results. (`#3675 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3675>`__)
- Change the APIs for :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_rectangle` and :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.submap` to be consistent with each other and to use keyword-only arguments for specifying the bounding box. (`#3677 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3677>`__)
- Updates the `~sunpy.map.mapbase.observer_coordinate` property to warn the user of specific missing metadata for each frame.
  Omits warning about frames where all metadata is missing or all meta is present. (`#3692 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3692>`__)
- Added `sunpy.util.config.copy_default_config` that copies the default config file to the user's config directory. (`#3722 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3722>`__)
- ``sunpy.database`` now supports adding database entries and downloading data from ``HEK`` query (`#3731 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3731>`__)
- Added a helper function (`~sunpy.coordinates.util.get_rectangle_coordinates`) for defining a rectangle in longitude and latitude coordinates. (`#3737 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3737>`__)
- Add a ``.data`` property in `~sunpy.timeseries.GenericTimeSeries`, so that users are encouraged to use `to_dataframe` to get the data of the timeseries. (`#3746 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3746>`__)
- It is now possible to turn on or off various corrections in :func:`~sunpy.coordinates.sun.L0` (the apparent Carrington longitude of Sun-disk center as seen from Earth). (`#3782 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3782>`__)
- Made skimage.transform import lazy to reduce import time of `sunpy.image.transform` by ~50% (`#3818 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3818>`__)
- Add support for parfive 1.1. This sets a limit on the number of open connections to JSOC when downloading files to 10. (`#3822 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3822>`__)
- Fido clients (subclasses of `sunpy.net.base_client.BaseClient`) can now register their own attrs modules with `sunpy.net.attrs`.
  This allows clients which require attr classes specific to that client to register modules that can be used by the user i.e. ``a.vso``.
  It also allows clients implemented externally to sunpy to register attrs. (`#3869 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3869>`__)
- Added the methods :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.quicklook` and :meth:`sunpy.map.MapSequence.quicklook` to display an HTML summary of the instance, including interactive controls.
  When using Jupyter notebooks, this HTML summary is automatically shown instead of a text-only representation. (`#3951 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3951>`__)
- Added `_localfilelist` method in `~sunpy.util.scraper.Scraper` to scrap local data archives. (`#3994 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3994>`__)
- Added extra constants to `sunpy.sun.constants`:

  - Longitude of the prime meridian (epoch J2000.0) : ``sunpy.sun.constants.get('W_0')``
  - Sidereal rotation rate : `sunpy.sun.constants.sidereal_rotation_rate`
  - First Carrington rotation (JD TT) : `sunpy.sun.constants.first_carrington_rotation`
  - Mean synodic period : `sunpy.sun.constants.mean_synodic_period`
  - Right ascension (RA) of the north pole (epoch J2000.0) : ``sunpy.sun.constants.get('alpha_0')``
  - Declination of the north pole (epoch J2000.0) : ``sunpy.sun.constants.get('delta_0')`` (`#4013 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4013>`__)
- Adds to `~sunpy.net.scraper.Scraper` the ability to include regular expressions in the URL passed. (`#4107 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4107>`__)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Added support for passing ``TimeSeriesMetaData`` object to ``timeseries_factory`` and associated validation tests. (`#3639 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3639>`__)
- Now when `~sunpy.map.GenericMap` fails to load a file, the filename that failed to load will now be part of the error message. (`#3727 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3727>`__)
- Work around incorrect Content-Disposition headers in some VSO downloads, which were leading to mangled filenames. (`#3740 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3740>`__)
- ``Fido.search`` can now service queries without ``a.Time`` being specified. This is currently only used by the `sunpy.net.jsoc.JSOCClient`. (`#3770 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3770>`__)
- Fixed a bug with the calculation of Carrington longitude as seen from Earth where it was using an old approach instead of the current approach (for example, the varying Sun-Earth distance is now taken into account).
  The old approach resulted in errors no greater than 7 arcseconds in Carrington longitude when using `~sunpy.coordinates.sun.L0` and `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliographicCarrington`. (`#3772 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3772>`__)
- Updated `sunpy.map.compositemap.plot` to support a linewidths argument. (`#3792 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3792>`__)

- Add support for passing paths of type `pathlib.Path` in `sunpy.net.jsoc.JSOCClient.fetch`. (`#3838 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3838>`__)
- Add explicit support for dealing with download urls for files, under 'as-is' protocol in `sunpy.net.jsoc.JSOCClient.get_request`. (`#3838 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3838>`__)
- Updated the method used to filter time in the VSO post-search filtering function. (`#3840 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3840>`__)
- Fix failing of fetching of the indexed JSOCResponses using `Fido.fetch`. (`#3852 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3852>`__)
- Prevented `GenericMap.plot` modifying in-place any items passed as ``imshow_kwargs``. (`#3867 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3867>`__)
- Changed the format of DATE-OBS in `GenericMap.wcs` from iso to isot (ie. with a "T" between the date and time) to conform with the FITS standard. (`#3872 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3872>`__)
- Fixed a minor error (up to ~10 arcseconds) in the calculation of the Sun's position angle (:func:`sunpy.coordinates.sun.P`). (`#3886 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3886>`__)
- `~sunpy.net.hek.HEKClient` was returning HTML and not JSON. (`#3899 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3899>`__)
- Updated to HTTPS for HEK. (`#3917 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3917>`__)
- The accuracy of the output of :func:`sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris.get_horizons_coord` is significantly improved. (`#3919 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3919>`__)
- Fixed a bug where the longitude value for the reference coordinate in the Map repr would be displayed with the unintended longitude wrapping. (`#3959 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3959>`__)
- It is now possible to specify a local file path to
  `sunpy.data.data_manager.DataManager.override_file` without having to prefix it
  with ``file://``. (`#3970 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3970>`__)
- Closed the session in the destructor of VSOClient thus solving the problem of socket being left open (`#3973 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3973>`__)
- Fixed a bug of where results of VSO searches would have inconsistent ordering in `~sunpy.net.vso.vso.QueryResponse` by always sorting the results by start time. (`#3974 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3974>`__)
- Fixes two bugs in `sunpy.util.decorator.deprecated`: correctly calculates the
  removal version and does not override the default and/or alternative functionality
  message. Providing a custom deprecation message now suppresses any
  mention of the removal version. Additionally, a `pending` keyword argument is
  provided to denote functions/classes that are pending deprecation. (`#3982 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3982>`__)
- Correctly generate labels for sliders in
  `~sunpy.visualization.animators.ArrayAnimatorWCS` when the number of pixel
  dimensions and the number of world dimensions are not the same in the WCS. (`#3990 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3990>`__)
- Updated VSOClient.response_block_properties to check if "None" is in the return. (`#3993 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3993>`__)
- Fix a bug with `sunpy.visualization.animator.ArrayAnimatorWCS` where animating
  a line with a masked array with the whole of the initial line masked out the
  axes limits for the x axis were not correctly set. (`#4001 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4001>`__)
- Fixed passing in a list of URLs into `sunpy.map.GenericMap`, before it caused an error due to the wrong type being returned. (`#4007 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4007>`__)
- Fixed a bug with :func:`~sunpy.coordinates.transformations.transform_with_sun_center` where the global variable was sometimes restored incorrectly.
  This bug was most likely encountered if there was a nested use of this context manager. (`#4015 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4015>`__)
- Fixes a bug in fido_factory to allow  path="./" in fido.fetch(). (`#4058 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4058>`__)
- Prevented `sunpy.io.fits.header_to_fits` modifying the passed header in-place. (`#4067 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4067>`__)
- Strip out any unknown unicode from the HEK response to prevent it failing to load some results. (`#4088 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4088>`__)
- Fixed a bug in :func:`~sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris.get_body_heliographic_stonyhurst` that resulted in a error when requesting an array of locations in conjuction with enabling the light-travel-time correction. (`#4112 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4112>`__)
- `sunpy.map.GenericMap.top_right_coord` and `~sunpy.map.map.GenericMap.center`
  have had their definitions clarified, and both have had off-by-one indexing
  errors fixed. (`#4121 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4121>`__)
- Fixed `sunpy.map.GenericMap.submap()` when scaled pixel units (e.g. ``u.mpix``)
  are used. (`#4127 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4127>`__)
- Fixed bugs in `~sunpy.util.scraper.Scraper.filelist`
  that resulted in error when the HTML page of URL opened by the scraper contains some "a" tags without "href" attribute
  and resulted in incorrect file urls when any href stores filepath relative to the URL's domain instead of just a filename. (`#4132 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4132>`__)
- Fixed inconsistencies in how `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.submap` behaves when passed corners in pixel and world coordinates.
  The behavior for submaps specified in pixel coordinates is now well-defined for pixels on the boundary of the rectangle
  and is consistent for all boundaries. Previously pixels on the lower left boundary were included, but excluded on the
  upper and right boundary. This means the shape of a submap may now be 1 pixel larger in each dimension.
  Added several more tests for `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.submap` for a range of cutout sizes in both pixel and world
  coordinates. (`#4134 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4134>`__)
- `sunpy.map.on_disk_bounding_coordinates` now fully propagates the coordinate
  frame of the input map to the output coordinates. Previously only the observer
  coordinate, and no other frame attributes, were propagated. (`#4141 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4141>`__)
- Fix an off-by-one error in the reference pixel returned by
  `sunpy.map.make_fitswcs_header`. (`#4152 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4152>`__)
- `sunpy.map.GenericMap.reference_pixel` now uses zero-based indexing, in order
  to be consistent with the rest of the `sunpy.map` API. (`#4154 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4154>`__)
- Previously `sunpy.map.GenericMap.resample` with ``method='linear'`` was
  using an incorrect and constant value to fill edges when upsampling a map. Values
  near the edges are now correctly extrapolated using the ``fill_value=extrapolate``
  option to `scipy.interpolate.interp1d`. (`#4164 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4164>`__)
- Fixed a bug where passing an `int` or `list` via the `hdus` keyword argument to
  `~sunpy.io.fits.read` threw an exception because the list of HDU objects was no longer
  of type `~astropy.io.fits.hdu.HDUList`. (`#4183 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4183>`__)
- Fix attr printing when the attr registry is empty for that attr (`#4199 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4199>`__)
- Improved the accuracy of :func:`~sunpy.coordinates.sun.angular_radius` by removing the use of the small-angle approximation.
  The inaccuracy had been less than 5 milliarcseconds. (`#4239 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4239>`__)
- Fixed a bug with the ``observer`` frame attribute for coordinate frames where an input that was not supplied as a `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` would sometimes result in a transformation error. (`#4266 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4266>`__)

Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Removed un-used and un-tested code paths in the private ``_remove_lytaf_events`` function
  in `sunpy.instr.lyra`. (`#3570 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3570>`__)
- Removed ``astropy_helpers`` and this means that ``python setup.py <test,build_docs>`` no longer works.
  So if you want to:

  * Run the tests: Use ``tox -e <env name>`` or call ``pytest`` directly
  * Build the docs: Use ``tox -e docs`` or cd into the docs folder and run ``make html`` or ``sphinx-build docs docs/_build/html -W -b html -d docs/_build/.doctrees`` (`#3598 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3598>`__)
- Cleaned up test warnings in sunpy.coordinates. (`#3652 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3652>`__)
- Fix Python version for requiring importlib_resources (`#3683 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3683>`__)
- `sunpy.net.attr.AttrWalker` no longer uses `sunpy.util.multimethod.MultiMethod` it uses a derivative of `functools.singledispatch` `sunpy.util.functools.seconddispatch` which dispatches on the second argument. (`#3714 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3714>`__)
- Errors from a VSO search will now be raised to the user. (`#3719 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3719>`__)
- Fixed the transformation test for `~sunpy.coordinates.metaframes.NorthOffsetFrame`, which would intermittently fail. (`#3775 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3775>`__)
- :func:`~sunpy.coordinates.sun.earth_distance` is now computed without using coordinate transformations for better performance. (`#3782 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3782>`__)
- Created a helper function for testing the equality/closeness of longitude angles (i.e., angles with wrapping). (`#3804 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3804>`__)
- Bump the astropy version figure tests are run with from 3.1.2 to 3.2.3 (`#3925 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3925>`__)
- Used `urllib.parse.urlsplit` in `~sunpy.util.scraper` for file scraping functionalities. (`#3956 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3956>`__)
- Added `sunpy.net.base_client.BaseClient.check_attr_types_in_query` as a helper method

sunpy v1.1.0 (2020-01-10)
=========================

Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- The `sunpy.net.vso.vso.get_online_vso_url` function has been broken into two components, the new `sunpy.net.vso.vso.get_online_vso_url` function takes no arguments (it used to take three) and now only returns an online VSO mirror or None.
  The construction of a `zeep.Client` object is now handled by `sunpy.net.vso.vso.build_client` which has a more flexible API for customising the `zeep.Client` interface. (`#3330 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3330>`__)
- Importing `sunpy.timeseries.timeseriesbase` no longer automatically imports
  Matplotlib. (`#3376 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3376>`__)
- `NOAAIndicesTimeSeries.peek` now checks that the `type` argument is a
  valid string, and raises a `ValueError` if it isn't. (`#3378 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3378>`__)
- Observer-based coordinate frames (`~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Heliocentric` and `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Helioprojective`) no longer assume a default observer (Earth) if no observer is specified.  These frames can now be used with no observer specified, but most transformations cannot be performed for such frames.  This removal of a default observer only affects `sunpy.coordinates`, and has no impact on the default observer in `sunpy.map`. (`#3388 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3388>`__)
- The callback functions provided to
  `~sunpy.visualization.animator.BaseFuncAnimator` ``button_func`` keyword
  argument now take two positional arguments rather than one. The function
  signature is now ``(animator, event)`` where the first arg is the animator
  object, and the second is the matplotlib mouse event. (`#3407 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3407>`__)
- The colormap stored in SunPy's Map subclasses (ie. ``map.plot_settings['cmap']``)
  can now be colormap string instead of the full `matplotlib.colormap.Colormap`
  object. To get the full `Colormap` object use the new attribute
  ``map.cmap``. (`#3412 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3412>`__)
- Fix a warning in `sunpy.map.GenericMap.rotate` where the truth value of an array
  was being calculated. This changes the behaviour of
  `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.rotate` when the ``angle=`` parameter is not an
  `~astropy.units.Quantity` object to raise `TypeError` rather than `ValueError`. (`#3456 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3456>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Removed the step of reparing images (replacing non-finite entries with local mean) before coaligning them. The user is expected to do this themselves before coaligning images. If NaNs/non-finite entries are present, a warning is thrown.
  The function `sunpy.image.coalignment.repair_image_nonfinite` is deprecated. (`#3287 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3287>`__)
- The method to convert a `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Helioprojective` frame from 2D to 3D has been renamed from `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Helioprojective.calculate_distance` to `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Helioprojective.make_3d`.  This method is not typically directly called by users. (`#3389 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3389>`__)
- `sunpy.visualization.animator.ImageAnimatorWCS` is now deprecated in favour of
  `~sunpy.visualization.animator.ArrayAnimatorWCS`. (`#3407 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3407>`__)
- ``sunpy.cm`` has been moved to `sunpy.visualization.colormaps` and will be
  removed in a future version. (`#3410 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3410>`__)


Features
--------

- Add a new `sunpy.data.manager` and `sunpy.data.cache` for dealing with versioned remote data within functions.
  Please see the `Remote Data Manager <https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/dev_guide/remote_data.html>`__ guide. (`#3124 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3124>`__)
- Added the coordinate frames `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliocentricEarthEcliptic` (HEE), `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.GeocentricSolarEcliptic` (GSE), `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliocentricInertial` (HCI), and `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.GeocentricEarthEquatorial` (GEI). (`#3212 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3212>`__)

- Adds support for searching and downloading SUVI data. (`#3301 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3301>`__)
- Log all VSO XML requests and responses to the SunPy logger at the ``DEBUG``
  level. (`#3330 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3330>`__)
- Transformations between frames in `sunpy.coordinates` can now provide detailed debugging output.  Set the `logging` level to ``DEBUG`` to enable this output. (`#3339 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3339>`__)
- Added the `sunpy.coordinates.sun.carrington_rotation_time` function to
  compute the time of a given Carrington rotation number. (`#3360 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3360>`__)
- A new method has been added to remove columns from a
  `sunpy.timeseries.GenericTimeSeries`. (`#3361 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3361>`__)
- Add `shape` property to TimeSeries. (`#3380 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3380>`__)
- Added ASDF schemas for the new coordinate frames (`~sunpy.coordinates.frames.GeocentricEarthEquatorial`, `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.GeocentricSolarEcliptic`, `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliocentricEarthEcliptic`, `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliocentricInertial`).  See the gallery for an example of using `asdf` to save and load a coordinate frame. (`#3398 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3398>`__)
- `sunpy.visualization.animator.ArrayAnimatorWCS` was added which uses the WCS
  object to get the coordinates of all axes, including the slider labels. It also provides the
  ability to customise the plot by specifying arguments to
  `~astropy.visualization.wcsaxes.WCSAxes` methods and supports animation of
  WCS aware line plots with Astroy 4.0. (`#3407 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3407>`__)
- The returned list of `~sunpy.map.Map` objects is now sorted by filename when
  passing a directory or glob pattern to `~sunpy.map.MapFactory`. (`#3408 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3408>`__)
- Single character wildcards and character ranges can now be passed as
  glob patterns to `~sunpy.map.Map`. (`#3408 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3408>`__)
- `~sunpy.map.Map` now accepts filenames and directories as `pathlib.Path`
  objects. (`#3408 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3408>`__)
- `~sunpy.map.GenericMap` objects now have a ``.cmap`` attribute, which returns the full `~matplotlib.colormap.Colormap`.
  object. (`#3412 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3412>`__)
- `sunpy.io.write_file()` now accepts `~pathlib.Path` objects as filename inputs. (`#3469 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3469>`__)
- `sunpy.map.make_fitswcs_header` now accepts a `tuple` representing the shape of an array as well as the actual array as the ``data`` argument. (`#3483 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3483>`__)
- Made a couple of module imports lazy to reduce the import time of sunpy.map by
  ~40%. (`#3495 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3495>`__)
- `sunpy.map.GenericMap.wcs` now uses the full FITS header to construct the WCS.
  This adds support for instruments with more complex projections, such as WISPR,
  however does mean that Map will be more sensitive to incorrect or invalid FITS
  headers. If you are using custom headers with SunPy Map you might encounter
  issues relating to this change. (`#3501 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3501>`__)
- `sunpy.visualization.animator.BaseFuncAnimator` now takes an optional
  ``slider_labels`` keyword argument which draws text labels in the center of the
  sliders. (`#3504 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3504>`__)
- Added a more helpful error message when trying to load a file or directory
  that doesn't exist with `Map`. (`#3568 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3568>`__)
- Add ``__repr__`` for `~sunpy.map.MapSequence` objects  so that users can view the
  critical information of all the ``Map`` objects, in a concise manner. (`#3636 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3636>`__)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed accuracy issues with the calculations of Carrington longitude (`~sunpy.coordinates.sun.L0`) and Carrington rotation number (`~sunpy.coordinates.sun.carrington_rotation_number`). (`#3178 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3178>`__)
- Updated `sunpy.map.header_helper.make_fitswcs_header` to be more strict on the inputs it accepts. (`#3183 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3183>`__)

- Fixed the missing transformation between two `~sunpy.coordinates.HeliographicCarrington` frames with different observation times. (`#3186 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3186>`__)
- `sunpy.map.sources.AIAMap` and `sunpy.map.sources.HMIMap` will no longer assume
  the existance of certain header keys. (`#3217 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3217>`__)
- `sunpy.map.make_fitswcs_header` now supports specifying the map projection
  rather than defaulting to ``TAN``. (`#3218 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3218>`__)
- Fix the behaviour of
  `sunpy.coordinates.frames.Helioprojective.calculate_distance` if the
  representation isn't Spherical. (`#3219 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3219>`__)
- Fixed a bug where the longitude of a coordinate would not wrap at the expected angle following a frame transformation. (`#3223 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3223>`__)
- Fixed a bug where passing a time or time interval to the differential rotation function threw an error because the new observer was not in HGS. (`#3225 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3225>`__)
- Fixed bug where `~sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris.get_horizons_coord` was unable to accept `~astropy.time.Time` arrays as input. (`#3227 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3227>`__)
- Fix the ticks on the default heliographic grid overlay so they are not white
  (and normally invisible) by default. (`#3235 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3235>`__)
- Fixed a bug with `sunpy.net.hek.HEKClient` when the results returned were a mixed dataset. (`#3240 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3240>`__)
- Fix `sunpy.physics.differential_rotation.differential_rotate` to rotate in the
  correct direction and to account for the rotation of the heliographic
  coordinate frame with time. (`#3245 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3245>`__)
- Fixed a bug with the handling of changing observation times for transformations between `~astropy.coordinates.HCRS` and `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliographicStonyhurst`, which also indirectly affected other transformations when changing observation times. (`#3246 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3246>`__)
- Fixed all coordinate transformations to properly handle a change in observation time. (`#3247 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3247>`__)
- Fixed the handling of coordinates with velocity information when transforming between Astropy frames and SunPy frames. (`#3247 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3247>`__)
- Fixed `~sunpy.physics.solar_rotation.calculate_solar_rotate_shift` so that it does not calculate a shift between the reference layer and itself, which would sometimes incorrectly result in a shift of a pixel due to numerical precision. (`#3255 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3255>`__)
- Stop crash when ``LineAnimator`` ``axes_ranges`` entry given as ``1D`` array when data is ``>1D``, i.e. as an independent axis. (`#3283 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3283>`__)
- Fixed a `sunpy.coordinates` bug where a frame using the default observer of Earth could have its observer overwritten during a transformation. (`#3291 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3291>`__)
- Fixed a bug where the transformation from `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Helioprojective` to `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Heliocentric` used the Sun-observer distance from the wrong frame when shifting the origin, and thus might not give the correct answer if the observer was not the same for the two frames. (`#3291 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3291>`__)
- Fixed a bug with the transformations between `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Heliocentric` and `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliographicStonyhurst` when the frame observation time was not the same as the observer observation time.  The most common way to encounter this bug was when transforming from `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.Helioprojective` to any non-observer-based frame while also changing the observation time. (`#3291 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3291>`__)
- VSO client `fetch` should not download when `wait` keyword argument is specified. (`#3298 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3298>`__)

- Fixed bugs with `~sunpy.coordinates.wcs_utils.solar_frame_to_wcs_mapping` if the input frame does not include an observation time or an observer. (`#3305 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3305>`__)
- `~sunpy.coordinates.utils.GreatArc` now accounts for the start and end points of the arc having different observers. (`#3334 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3334>`__)
- Fixed situations where 2D coordinates provided to `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliographicStonyhurst` and `~sunpy.coordinates.frames.HeliographicCarrington` were not converted to 3D as intended.  Furthermore, the stored data will always be the post-conversion, 3D version. (`#3351 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3351>`__)
- Fix off by one error in `sunpy.map.make_fitswcs_header` where when using the
  default ``reference_pixel=None`` keyword argument the pixel coordinate of the
  reference pixel was off by +1. (`#3356 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3356>`__)
- Updated both GOES XRS and LYRA dataretriever clients to use `~sunpy.util.scraper.Scraper`, to make sure that files are actually on the servers being queried. (`#3367 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3367>`__)
- Fixing the ordering of lon and lat inputs into make_fitswcs_header (`#3371 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3371>`__)

- Fixed a malformed call to `astropy.time.Time` in a test, which resulted in an incorrect time scale (UTC instead of TT). (`#3418 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3418>`__)
- Fix incorrect files being included in the tarball, and docs missing from the
  tarball (`#3423 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3423>`__)
- Fixed a bug where clipping behavior had been enabled by default in the plotting normalizers for ``Map`` objects.  Clipping needs to be disabled to make use of the over/under/masked colors in the colormap. (`#3427 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3427>`__)
- Fix a bug with observer based frames that prevented a coordinate with an array of obstimes being transformed to other frames. (`#3455 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3455>`__)
- `sunpy.map.GenericMap` will no longer raise a warning if the posisition of the
  observer is not known for frames that don't need an observer, i.e. heliographic
  frames. (`#3462 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3462>`__)

  ``CUNIT1/2`` metadata is not set to a known value. (`#3569 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3569>`__)
- Fixed bugs with some coordinate transformations when ``obstime`` is ``None`` on the destination frame but can be assumed to be the same as the ``obstime`` of the source frame. (`#3576 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3576>`__)
- Updated `sunpy.map.mapsequence.MapSequence` so that calling ``_derotate()`` raises ``NotImplementedError``.
  Added associated tests. (`#3613 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3613>`__)
- Fixed pandas plotting registration in `sunpy.timeseries`. (`#3633 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3633>`__)

========================

Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- Move the matplotlib animators from ``sunpy.visualisation.imageanimator`` and
  ``sunpy.visualization.mapcubeanimator`` to `sunpy.visualization.animator`. (`#2515 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2515>`__)
- Make `sunpy.time.parse_time` return `astropy.time.Time` instead of `datetime.datetime`. (`#2611 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2611>`__)
- The properties and methods of `sunpy.time.TimeRange` returns `astropy.time.Time` and `astropy.time.TimeDelta` instead of `datetime.datetime` and `datetime.timedelta` respectively. (`#2638 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2638>`__)
- The `sunpy.instr.goes` module now accepts and returns
  `sunpy.timeseries.XRSTimeSeries` objects only. (`#2666 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2666>`__)
- ``obstime`` keyword param of ``sunpy.instr.goes._goes_lx`` takes a non-scalar `astropy.time.Time` object instead of `numpy.ndarray`. The precision of times contained in `sunpy.timeseries` has been increased to 9 from 6. (`#2676 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2676>`__)
- Removed ``sunpy.net.jsoc.attrs.Time`` because it served the same purpose as `sunpy.net.attrs.Time` after the switch to `astropy.time.Time`. (`#2694 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2694>`__)
- Remove unused ``**kwargs`` within TimeSeries functions. (`#2717 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2717>`__)
- Rotation matrices inside map objects were previously stored as numpy matrices, but are now
  stored as numpy arrays, as numpy will eventually remove their matrix datatype. See

  support the new parfive downloader and to ensure consisteny across all Fido
  clients. (`#2797 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2797>`__)
- The Helioviewer client has been switched to using the newer Helioviewer API.
  This has meant that we have changed some of the keywords that were passed into client's methods.
  We have enforced that several keywords (observatory,instrument,detector,measurement) need to be defined otherwise the functions cannot return any data. (`#2801 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2801>`__)
- Maps no longer assume that the pixel units are arcseconds if the units aren't
  explicitly set. In addition to this if critical metadata is missing from when
  creating a map, the map will fail to initialize and will raise an error. (`#2847 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2847>`__)
- axis_ranges kwarg of `sunpy.visualization.animator.base.ArrayAnimator`, `sunpy.visualization.animator.image.ImageAnimator` and `sunpy.visualization.animator.line.LineAnimator` now must be entered as None, [min, max] or pixel edges of each array element. Previously, pixel centers were expected.  This change removes ambiguity in interpretation and ensures the extent of the plot can always be accurately derived. (`#2867 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2867>`__)
- All keywords have been added (with defaults) to each `~sunpy.net.helioviewer.HelioviewerClient` function.
  This means that there will be some changes to the style of the PNG screenshot that is returned.
  Returns for the JPEG 2000 and the other functions should be the same but not guaranteed. (`#2883 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2883>`__)
- Changed `sunpy.sun.models.interior` and `sunpy.sun.models.evolution` from `pandas.DataFrame` to `astropy.table.QTable` (`#2936 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2936>`__)
- Minimum numpy version is now >=1.14.5 (`#2954 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2954>`__)
- Removed ``sunpy.time.julian_day``, ``sunpy.time.julian_centuries``, ``sunpy.time.day_of_year``, ``sunpy.time.break_time``, ``sunpy.time.get_day``. (`#2999 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2999>`__)
- Updated the solar values in `sunpy.sun.constants` to IAU 2015 values. (`#3001 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3001>`__)
- Renamed `eccentricity_sunearth_orbit` to `eccentricity_sun_earth_orbit`. (`#3001 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3001>`__)
- Renamed ``sunpy.image.rescale`` to `sunpy.image.resample`. (`#3044 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3044>`__)
- Remove the ``basic_plot`` keyword argument from
  `~sunpy.map.Map.GenericMap.peek`. An example has been added to the gallery
  showing how to make a plot like this. (`#3109 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3109>`__)
- `sunpy.map.GenericMap` will no longer use the key `solar_b0` as a value for heliographic latitude. (`#3115 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3115>`__)
- `sunpy.map.GenericMap` now checks for a complete observer location rather than
  individually defaulting coordinates (lat, lon, distance) to Earth position. If
  any one of the three coordinates is missing from the header the observer will
  be defaulted to Earth and a warning raised. (`#3115 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3115>`__)
- `sunpy.sun.sun` functions have been re-implemented using Astropy for significantly improved accuracy.  Some functions have been removed. (`#3137 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3137>`__)
- All of the functions in `sunpy.sun.sun` and all of the Sun-specific functions in `sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris` have been moved to the new module `sunpy.coordinates.sun`. (`#3163 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3163>`__)

- Removed `~sunpy.sun.sun.solar_cycle_number` because it was fundamentally flawed (`#3150 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3150>`__)


Features
--------

- Change arguments to `sunpy.test` from ``offline=`` and ``online=`` to ``online`` and ``online_only``. This matches the behavior of the figure keyword arguments and comes as a part of a move to using a modified version of the Astropy test runner. (`#1983 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/1983>`__)
- asdf schemas and tags were added for the SunPy coordinate frames and `~sunpy.map.GenericMap` allowing these objects to be saved to and restored from `asdf <https://asdf.readthedocs.io/>`__ files. (`#2366 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2366>`__)
- The images from image tests are now saved in a local folder for easy access. (`#2507 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2507>`__)
- ``sunpy.map.MapCube`` has been renamed to `sunpy.map.MapSequence` to better reflect its use as a collection of map objects. (`#2603 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2603>`__)
- Net search attributes now support tab completion of values and display a table of possible values when printed, to allow easier discoverability of possible search values. (`#2663 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2663>`__)
- Running the figure tests now creates a page showing the differences between
  the expected figures and the figures produced from running the tests. (`#2681 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2681>`__)
- Add support for Dask arrays in `sunpy.map.Map`. The map factory now checks a whitelist
  of array types rather than strictly checking if the array is of type `numpy.ndarray`. (`#2689 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2689>`__)
- Persist the name of a coordinate, i.e. "earth" even though a concrete
  coordinate object has been calculated and use this string representation to change
  the way the sunpy frames are printed. This is primarily to facilitate displaying
  the name of the body rather than the concrete coordinate when printing a
  `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord`. (`#2723 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2723>`__)
- `~sunpy.net.hek.HEKClient.search` now returns an `astropy.table.Table` instead of list of a `dict`. (`#2759 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2759>`__)

- The download manager for `Fido.fetch <sunpy.net.fido_factory.UnifiedDownloader.fetch>` has been replaced with
  `parfive <https://parfive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. This provides advanced
  progress bars, proper handling of overwriting and the ability to retry failed
  downloads. (`#2797 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2797>`__)
- `sunpy.map.GenericMap` can now save out rice compressed FITS files. (`#2826 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2826>`__)

- Added full Tox support for SunPy tests, documentation build and figure tests. (`#2839 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2839>`__)
- Transition the `sunpy.net.vso.VSOClient` from using suds to `zeep <https://python-zeep.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`__ as the SOAP
  library. This is a more actively maintained library, and should provide better
  support for the VSOs https endpoints. This change should have no effect on the
  public API of the `sunpy.net.vso.VSOClient`. (`#2866 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2866>`__)
- Provided access to the Helioviewer header information using `~sunpy.net.helioviewer.HelioviewerClient.get_jp2_header` function. (`#2904 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2904>`__)

- The function `sunpy.image.coalignment.get_correlation_shifts` now issues an error when the number of dimensions
  are not correct instead of a warning and returning None. (`#2980 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2980>`__)
- The default location of the sunpy sample data has changed to be in the platform
  specific data directory as provided by `appdirs <https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs>`__. (`#2993 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2993>`__)

- The default style for Map plots have changed to reflect the changes in Astropy
  3.2. (`#3054 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3054>`__)
- `sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris.get_body_heliographic_stonyhurst` can now account for light travel time when computing the (apparent) body position, as long as the observer location is provided. (`#3055 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3055>`__)
- Added a helper function (`sunpy.map.make_fitswcs_header`) that allows users to create a meta header for custom created `sunpy.map.GenericMap`. (`#3083 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3083>`__)
- Map plotting now accepts the optional keyword `clip_interval` for specifying a percentile interval for clipping.  For example, if the interval (5%, 99%) is specified, the bounds of the z axis are chosen such that the lowest 5% of pixels and the highest 1% of pixels are excluded. (`#3100 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3100>`__)
- The new function `~sunpy.coordinates.get_horizons_coord` enables querying JPL HORIZONS for the locations of a wide range of solar-system bodies, including spacecraft. (`#3113 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3113>`__)

0.8.0
======

New Features
------------

-  Solar differential rotation for maps and submaps included.
-  Solar rotation calculation and mapcube derotation now use sunpy coordinates.
-  Sample data now downloads automatically on import if not available
   and is now pluggable so can be used by affiliated packages. Shortcut
   names have been normalized and all LIGHTCURVE shortcuts have changed
   to TIMESERIES.
-  Calculation of points on an arc of a great circle connecting two
   points on the Sun.
-  Removed ``extract_time`` function from ``sunpy.time`` and also tests
   related to the function from ``sunpy.time.tests``
-  User can now pass a custom time format as an argument inside
   ``sunpy.database.add_from_dir()`` in case the ``date-obs`` metadata
   cannot be read automatically from the files.
-  Add time format used by some SDO HMI FITS keywords
-  Now the ``sunpy.database.tables.display_entries()`` prints an astropy
   table.
-  Additional methods added inside the ``sunpy.database`` class to make
   it easier to display the database contents.
-  Remove unused ``sunpy.visualization.plotting`` module
-  Port the pyana wrapper to Python 3
-  ``Map.peek(basic_plot-True)`` no longer issues warnings
-  Remove the ``sunpy.map.nddata_compat`` module, this makes
   ``Map.data`` and ``Map.meta`` read only.
-  Add a ``NorthOffsetFrame`` class for generating HGS-like coordinate
   systems with a shifted north pole.
-  Remove deprecated ``VSOClient.show`` method.
-  Deprecate ``sunpy.wcs``: ``sunpy.coordinates`` and ``sunpy.map`` now
   provide all that functionality in a more robust manner.
-  Added hdu index in ``sunpy.database.tables.DatabaseEntry`` as a
   column in the table.
-  Removed ``HelioviewerClient`` from the ``sunpy.net`` namespace. It
   should now be imported with
   ``from sunpy.net.helioviewer import HelioviewerClient``.
-  Removed compatibility with standalone ``wcsaxes`` and instead depend
   on the version in astropy 1.3. SunPy now therefore depends on
   astropy>-1.3.
-  Update to ``TimeRange.__repr__``; now includes the qualified name and
   ``id`` of the object.
-  A new ``sunpy.visualization.imageanimator.LineAnimator`` class has
   been added to animate 1D data. This has resulted in API change for
   the ``sunpy.visualization.imageanimator.ImageAnimator`` class. The
   updateimage method has been renamed to update\_plot.
-  Drop support for Python 3.4.
-  SunPy now requires WCSAxes and Map.draw\_grid only works with
   WCSAxes.
-  ``Helioprojective`` and ``HelioCentric`` frames now have an
   ``observer`` attribute which itself is a coordinate object
   (``SkyCoord``) instead of ``B0``, ``L0`` and ``D0`` to describe the
   position of the observer.
-  ``GenericMap.draw_grid`` now uses ``WCSAxes``, it will only work on a
   ``WCSAxes`` plot, this may be less performant than the previous
   implementation.
-  ``GenericMap.world_to_pixel`` and ``GenericMap.pixel_to_world`` now
   accept and return ``SkyCoord`` objects only.
-  ``GenericMap`` has a new property ``observer_coordinate`` which
   returns a ``SkyCoord`` describing the position of the observer.
-  ``GenericMap.submap`` now takes arguments of the form ``bottom_left``
   and ``top_right`` rather than ``range_a`` and ``range_b``. This
   change enables submap to properly handle rotated maps and take input
   in the form of ``SkyCoord`` objects.
-  When referring to physical coordinates ``Pair.x`` has been replaced
   with ``SpatialPair.axis1``. This means values returned by
   ``GenericMap`` now differentiate between physical and pixel
   coordinates.
-  The physical radius of the Sun (length units) is now passed from Map
   into the coordinate frame so a consistent value is used when
   calculating distance to the solar surface in the
   ``HelioprojectiveFrame`` coordinate frame.
-  A new ``sunpy.visualization.imageanimator.ImageAnimatorWCS`` class
   has been added to animate N-Dimensional data with the associated WCS
   object.
-  Moved Docs to docs/ to follow the astropy style
-  Added SunPy specific warnings under util.
-  SunPy coordinate frames can now be transformed to and from Astropy
   coordinate frames
-  The time attribute for SunPy coordinate frames has been renamed from
   ``dateobs`` to ``obstime``
-  Ephemeris calculations with higher accuracy are now available under
   ``sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris``
-  Add support for SunPy coordinates to specify observer as a string of
   a major solar-system body, with the default being Earth. To make
   transformations using an observer specified as a string, ``obstime``
   must be set.
-  Added VSO query result block level caching in the database module.
   This prevents re-downloading of files which have already been
   downloaded. Especially helpful in case of overlapping queries.
-  Change the default representation for the Heliographic Carrington
   frame so Longitude follows the convention of going from 0-360
   degrees.
-  All Clients that are able to search and download data now have a
   uniform API that is `search` and `fetch`. The older functions are
   still there but are deprecated for 0.8.

.data attribute. \* make\_map is deprecated in favor of Map which is a
new factory class \* sunpy.map.Map is now sunpy.map.GenericMap \*
mymap.header is now mymap.meta \* attributes of the map class are now
read only, changes have to be made through map.meta \* new MapMeta class
to replace MapHeader, MapMeta is not returned by sunpy.io \* The
groundwork for GenericMap inherting from astropy.NDData has been done,
