def calculate_solar_rotate_shift(mc, layer_index=0, **kwargs):
    """
    Calculate the shift that must be applied to each map contained in a mapcube
    in order to compensate for solar rotation.

    The center of the map is used to calculate the position of each mapcube
    layer. Shifts are calculated relative to a specified layer in the mapcube.
    When using this functionality, it is a good idea to check that the shifts
    that were applied to were reasonable and expected. One way of checking this
    is to animate the original mapcube, animate the derotated mapcube, and
    compare the differences you see to the calculated shifts. An example use is
    as follows. If you select data from the SDO cutout service, it is common to
    not use the solar tracking implemented by this service. This is because (at
    time of writing) the solar tracking implemented by that service moves the
    image by single pixels at a time. This is not optimal for many use cases,
    as it introduces artificial jumps in the data. So with solar tracking not
    chosen, the selected area is like a window through which you can see the
    Sun rotating underneath.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mc : `sunpy.map.MapCube`
        The input mapcube.
    layer_index : int
        The index layer.  Shifts are calculated relative to the time of
        this layer.
    ``**kwargs``
        These keywords are passed to the function
        `sunpy.physics.differential_rotation.solar_rotate_coordinate`.
    Returns
    -------
    x, y : `~astropy.units.Quantity`, ~astropy.units.Quantity`
        The shifts relative to the index layer that can be applied
        to the input mapcube in order to compensate for solar rotation.
        The shifts are given in arcseconds as understood in helioprojective
        coordinates systems.

    """
    Move the layers in a mapcube according to the input shifts.
    If an input shift is not given, the shifts due to
    solar rotation relative to an index layer is calculated and
    applied.  When using this functionality, it is a good idea to check
    that the shifts that were applied to were reasonable and expected.
    One way of checking this is to animate the original mapcube, animate
    the derotated mapcube, and compare the differences you see to the
    calculated shifts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mc : `sunpy.map.MapCube`
        A mapcube of shape (ny, nx, nt), where nt is the number of layers in
        the mapcube.
    layer_index : int
        Solar derotation shifts of all maps in the mapcube are assumed
        to be relative to the layer in the mapcube indexed by layer_index.
    clip : bool
        If True, then clip off x, y edges in the datacube that are potentially
        affected by edges effects.
