;
; SunPy Configuration
;
; This is a sample sunpy configuration file - you can find a copy
; of it on your system in site-packages/sunpy/data/sunpyrc.  If you edit it
; there, please note that it will be overridden in your next install.
; If you want to keep a permanent local copy that will not be
; over-written, place it in HOME/.sunpy/sunpyrc (unix/linux
; like systems) and C:\Documents and Settings\yourname\.sunpy
; (win32 systems).
;

;
; DOWNLOAD OPTIONS
;
; By default, SunPy downloads all data to a temporary directory on your system
; path. To save data to a more permanent location you can either specify a
; filepath to use for the save_directory setting below, or specify a filepath
; as a keyword argument for the command downloading the data.
