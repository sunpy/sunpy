    UT seconds from 1979-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, ignoring leap seconds.

    Notes
    -----
    This format is very similar to the default output format of the the ``anytim``
    routine in SSW.  However, there are discrepancies of up to a second on days with
    a leap second.

    This format is equivalent to `~astropy.time.TimeUnix`, except that the epoch is
    9 years later.

    SI seconds from 1958-01-01 00:00:00, which includes UTC leap seconds.

    1958-01-01 00:00:00 is the defined time when International Atomic Time (TAI)
    and Universal Time (UT) are synchronized.  A TAI second has the same length as
    an SI second, but prior to 1972-01-01, a UT second -- then defined to be 1/86400
    of an Earth day -- grew to be longer than than an SI second.  1972-01-01
    00:00:00 UTC is equal to 1972-01-01 00:00:10 TAI.  After 1972-01-01, Coordinated
    Universal Time (UTC) is defined with seconds that are the same length as SI
    seconds, but now leap seconds are occasionally added to UTC so that it stays
    synchronized with Earth days.

    Notes
    -----
    This format is equivalent to the output of the SSW ``anytim2tai`` routine, and
    related routines, for times after 1972-01-01.  Be aware that the SSW routines
    are not written to provide valid results for times before 1972-01-01.

    This format is equivalent to `~astropy.time.TimeUnixTai`, except that the epoch
    is 12 years earlier.
