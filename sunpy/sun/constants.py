Fundamental Solar Physical Constants
------------------------------------
These constants are taken from various sources. The structure of this module is heavily 
based on if not directly copied from the SciPy constants module but contains Solar 
Physical constants. All units are in SI (mks) unless otherwise specified.

Object
------
physical_constants : dict
    A dictionary containing physical constants. Keys are the names
    of physical constants, values are tuples (value, units, precision). The dictionary
    contains the following solar physical constants:
        
    GM: 
        The gravitational constant multiplied by the mass of the Sun.
    absolute magnitude: 
        The absolute visual magnitude of the Sun. It is the measure of the Sun's intrinsic 
        brightness. It is the apparent magnitude the Sun would have if it were 32.6 light
        years (10 parsecs) away from Earth.
    average density:
         The average density of the Sun in SI.
    average_angular_size: 
        The average angular size of the Sun as seen from Earth in arcseconds.
    center density:
        The density at the center of the Sun in SI.
    center temperature:
        The temperature at the center of the Sun in Kelvin.
    diameter: 
        The diameters of the Sun at the equator in meters.
    effective temperature:
        The effective black-body temperature of the Sun in Kelvin.  
    ellipticity: 
        The ellipticity of the Sun.
    escape velocity: 
        The velocity which an object needs to escape from the gravitational pull of the Sun.
    luminosity:
        The luminosity of the Sun in Joules per second.
    mass:
        The mass of the Sun in kg.
    mass conversion rate:
        The rate at which the Sun converts mass to energy.
    mean energy production:
        The mean rate at which the Sun produces energy in Joules per second
    mean intensity:
        The mean intensity of the Sun.
    metallicity: 
        The metallicity of the Sun
    radius:
        The radius of the Sun at the equator in meters.
    solar flux unit:
        The definition of a solar flux unit.
    sunspot cycle:
        The average duration of the solar activity cycle.
    surface area:
        The surface area of the Sun in meters squared. 
    surface gravity:
        The gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Sun as measured at the equator.
    visual magnitude:
       A measure of the Sun's brightness as seen by an observer on Earth without the
       presence of the atmosphere.
    volume:
        The volume of the Sun in meters cubed.

Attributes
----------
A number of variables from physical_constants are made available for convenience as 
attributes. They are equatorial_radius, radius (same as equatorial radius), equatorial_diameter, volume, surface_area, average_density, center_density, 
equatorial_surface_gravity, mean_intensity, effective_temperature, center_temperature, 
luminosity, absolute_magnitude, visual_magnitude, mass_conversion_rate, 
mean_energy_production, escape_velocity, ellipticity, GM, average_angular_size, sfu.

Source
------
Constants are imported from Review of Particle Physics 2010 (page 102), 
and NASA's Sun Fact Sheet as well as other sources.
