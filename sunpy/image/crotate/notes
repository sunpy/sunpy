NB: 
Due to mix of Python and Tortoise v1.5, can't have "external" aff_tr.* -
need to have a whole directory (transform).

Choice of float32 and float64 for the actual calc - int16 as input is
fine because cast is automatic (and we don't eben have to know here),
int16_t output works but not much point as GPU's do float32 which can
contain int16.

DONE## put sinc as option extra code & dict(?) for type - consts?
   geom_extn.SINC

## try kernel_resp on it

## libs - e.g. libm - DONE I think

## CFLAGS - O3 and c99 !! - also DONE it seems
