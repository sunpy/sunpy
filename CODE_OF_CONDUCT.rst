Code of Conduct
===============

The SunPy community is made up of members from around the globe with a
diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through
these differences that our community experiences success and continued
growth. We expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines
when interacting with others both inside and outside of our community.
Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing
community.

A member of SunPy is:

Open
----

Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether on patches,
reporting issues, asking for help or otherwise. We welcome those
interested in joining the community, and realise that including people
with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our
community.

We are accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities,
fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can
make a difference, ensuring that all participants are heard and feel
confident that they can freely express their opinions.

Considerate
-----------

Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other
developers, users, etc. We are thoughtful when addressing the efforts of
others, keeping in mind that often the labour was completed simply for
the good of the community. We are attentive in our communications,
whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching
differing views.

We recognise the work made by everyone and ensure the proper
acknowledgement/citation of original authors at all times. As authors,
we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or
acknowledged.

Respectful
----------

Members of the community are respectful. We are respectful of others,
their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We
are respectful of the volunteer and professional efforts within the
community. We are respectful of the processes set forth in the
community, and we work within them (paying particular attention to those
new to the community).

When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues. We provide a
harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual
orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular,
sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary
jokes are not appropriate. We will treat those outside our community
with the same respect as people within our community.

Overall, we are good to each other and apply this CoC to all community
situations online and offline, including mailing lists, forums, social
media, conferences, meetings, associated social events, and one-to-one
interactions.

We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and
to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. We
will take action when members of our community violate this code such as
contacting confidential@sunpy.org (all emails sent to this address will
be treated with the strictest confidence) or talking privately with the
person.

Parts of this code of conduct have been adapted from the
`astropy <http://www.astropy.org/about.html>`__ and the `Python Software
Fundation <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>`__ codes of
conduct.
