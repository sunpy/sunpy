# This code block is executed, although it produces no output. Lines starting
# with a simple hash are code comment and get treated as part of the code
# block. To include this new comment string we started the new block with a
# long line of hashes.

# The sphinx-gallery parser will assume everything after this splitter and that
# continues to start with a **comment hash and space** (respecting code style)
# is text that has to be rendered in
# html format. Keep in mind to always keep your comments always together by
# comment hashes. That means to break a paragraph you still need to commend
# that line break.
#
# In this example the next block of code produces some plotable data. Code is
# executed, figure is saved and then code is presented next, followed by the
# inlined figure.

# where ``X`` is the figure number you want (from 1).
# We suggest putting this at the end.
