Downloading and plotting an HMI magnetogram

This example shows how to download a HMI magnetogram data with Fido and make a plot.

# To download the required data, we use
# `Fido <sunpy.net.fido_factory.UnifiedDownloaderFactory>`, a downloader client,
# to query the Joint Science Operations Center, or JSOC, where HMI data are stored.
# First define the search variables, a timerange,
# a `data series <http://jsoc.stanford.edu/JsocSeries_DataProducts_map.html>`_,
# keywords, and your e-mail address (to notify you when the download is complete).
# See the JSOC e-mail address registration page
# `here <http://jsoc.stanford.edu/ajax/register_email.html>`_.

result = Fido.search(a.Time('2014/11/20 00:00:00', '2014/11/20 00:04:00'),
                     a.jsoc.Series("hmi.M_720s"),
                     a.jsoc.Keys(["T_REC, CROTA2"]),
                     a.jsoc.Notify("jsoc@cadair.com"))

# Now we can see what results we obtained from our search.
# Notice we have two files.
print(result)

###############################################################################
# The following shows how to download the results. If we
# don't provide a path it will download the file into the sunpy data directory.
# The output provides the path of the downloaded files.
# The result can be from several data clients, so we have to index the client first
# and then index the file.

# Slice the first record returned by the first client.
downloaded_file = Fido.fetch(result[0])
print(downloaded_file)

###############################################################################
# Now load it into a map and plot it.
# We see that solar North is pointed down instead of up in this image, which is
# indicated by the coordinates (that range from positive to negative, rather
# than negative to positive).
hmi_map = sunpy.map.Map(downloaded_file[0])
fig = plt.figure()
hmi_map.plot()
plt.show()

###############################################################################
# Now rotate the image such that solar North is pointed up.
# We have to do this because the HMI instrument is mounted upside-down
# relative to the AIA instrument on the SDO satellite, which means most
# of the images are taken with solar North pointed up.
# The roll angle of the instrument is reported in the FITS header
# keyword `CROTA2` (see Figure 17 of
# `Couvidat et al. (2016) <https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11207-016-0957-3>`_,
# which states that "the nominal CROTA2 for HMI is â‰ˆ179.93").
#
# The order keyword, below, specifies the type of interpolation;
# in this case, 3 refers to bi-cubic.
