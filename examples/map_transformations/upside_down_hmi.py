Rotating HMI maps so they're not 'upside-down'
==============================================

This example shows how to rotate a HMI magnetogram, so when you plot it
it appears with solar North pointing up.

# We will use the ``sunpy`` HMI sample image, load it into a map and plot it.
# We see that solar North is pointed down instead of up in this image, which is
# indicated by the coordinates (that range from positive to negative, rather
# than negative to positive).

# Now rotate the image such that solar North is pointed up.
# We have to do this because the HMI instrument is mounted upside-down
# relative to the AIA instrument on the SDO satellite, which means most
# of the images are taken with solar North pointed up.
# The roll angle of the instrument is reported in the FITS header
# keyword ``CROTA2`` (see Figure 17 of
# `Couvidat et al. (2016) <https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11207-016-0957-3>`_,
# which states that "the nominal CROTA2 for HMI is â‰ˆ179.93").
#
# The order keyword, below, specifies the type of interpolation;
# in this case, 3 refers to bi-cubic.
