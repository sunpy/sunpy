========================================
Aligning AIA and HMI Data with Reproject
========================================

This example shows how to reproject one image to be aligned with another image.

Here we use the `reproject <https://reproject.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__
package to transform one image to the reference frame of another image.  The
reference frames are defined by the respective World Coordinate System (WCS)
information.  This is a very generic way of aligning data, and can be very
accurate.

You will need ``reproject`` v0.6 or higher installed.

See :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_gallery_map_transformations_autoalign_aia_hmi.py`
for an alternate approach to image alignment, where the images are aligned
as they are plotted, with no modified map created.
