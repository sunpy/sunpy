This gallery contains some examples of how to use SunPy. Most of these examples require the SunPy sample data, which you can download by running::

     >>> import sunpy.data
     >>> sunpy.data.download_sample_data()

Once downloaded the data will be stored in your user directory and you will not need to download it again.
