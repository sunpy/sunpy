The SunPy project is happy to announce the release of SunPy 0.8.0.

SunPy 0.8 is the next major release of SunPy and contains 1390 commits in 200
pull requests, closing 163 issues from 34 people, 16 of which have never
contributed before.

This release is a large milestone for the SunPy library. It contains large new
features that have been in development for a number of years, and will form the
foundation of SunPy for the future. The main additions are `sunpy.net.Fido` and
`sunpy.timeseries`, as well as major upgrades to `sunpy.coordinates`. Along with
this it deprecates some old parts of SunPy that have been rewritten, two
submodules `sunpy.lightcurve` and `sunpy.wcs` have been superseded by
`sunpy.timeseries` and `sunpy.coordinates` respectively.

In addition to the code contributions I would like to highlight the work of
Nabil Freij who has done a lot of work in the last few months releasing bug
fixes for the 0.7 series as well as a lot of behind the scenes work on SunPy's
tooling. I would also like to thank Duygu Keşkek who has redesigned the
sunpy.org page and the documentation as part of her GSOC project. Finally, I
would like to welcome Monica Bobra and Sabrina Savage to the SunPy Board.
