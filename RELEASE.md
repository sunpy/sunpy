The SunPy project is happy to announce the release of SunPy 0.7.0.

SunPy 0.7 is the next major release of SunPy and contains 665 commits from 27
people, 11 of which have never contributed before. The major features of this
release are:

* Python 3.4 and 3.5 support. This is the first version of SunPy to support
  Python 3, we recommend that users start to consider moving to Python 3, please
  report any issues you may have.
* New coordinate framework. The new `sunpy.coordinates` module provides a
  high-level interface to converting between different physical coordinate
  systems such as Helioprojective and Heliographic.
* New `draw_rectangle` and `draw_contours` helpers for `Map`.
* New functions `flareclass_to_flux` and `flux_to_flareclass` which convert
  between GOES flux to GOES class numbers (e.g. X12, M3.4).
* Support for masks in SunPy `Map` and `MapCube`.
