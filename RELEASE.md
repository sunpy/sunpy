The SunPy project is happy to announce the release of SunPy 0.6.0.
This is a major SunPy release with lots of changes that will make SunPy even
better than it was before.
This release consists of 1,341 commits from 29 different people and
13 new contributors!

The major changes in this release are:

    * Most functions throughout the SunPy code base expect Astropy
      Quantity objects, and return Astropy Quantity objects.
    * Python 2.6 support has ended, we do not expect this release to
      work under Python 2.6.
    * Sample data has been removed from SunPy but helpers for
      downloading sample data have been added to sunpy.data.
    * TimeRange has a new property based API, e.g. start and end are
      now properties.
    * Map.rotate() now pads arrays to prevent loss of data under
      rotation.
    * Map.rotate() now defaults to the slower but more accurate
      bi-quartic interpolation method (order=4).
    * SunPy colormaps are now registered with matplotlib, allowing
      their use from imshow and similar functions after the import
      of sunpy.cm.
    * JSOC client export calls now checks for an email address.
    * Solar rotation calculation functionality has been added, along
      with functionality to de-rotate MapCubes.
    * Files downloaded through the VSO now keep their file
      extension.
