How to Contribute to SunPy
--------------------------------

Thanks for your interest in contributing to SunPy!

SunPy is an open project that enourages everyone to contribute in any way possible.
Although this document mainly focuses on how to make contributions to SunPy code
and documentation, there are many other ways to get involved with the SunPy
community. A good place to start is by saying hello on
the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy)
or [matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#sunpy-general:matrix.org).


## Reporting Issues

If you have found a problem when using SunPy the best way to report it and get
some help is by opening an [issue](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues) on our
GitHub issue tracker.

You will need to sign in to [GitHub](github.com) to report an issue. If you are not
already a member of Github, you will have to join. Joining GitHub will also
make it easier to report and track issues in the future.

If you do not want to join Github, then another way to report your issue is
email the SunPy developers
list
[sunpy-dev@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy-dev).


Issue reports should provide a short description of the issue. If you are
reporting a bug, please post a code sample so others can attempt to reproduce
the error. Please also post any error output generated by the bug. For a good
example of how to do this see issue [#1191](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues/1191).

If you are making a feature request, please post as much information as possible
regarding the feature you would like to see in SunPy.


## Finding Things to Contribute to

If you want to contribute to SunPy but don't know where to start, we maintain a
list of issues that are good as a starting place, these can be found under the
[package-novice](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apackage-novice)
label.


## Making a Code or Documentation Contribution

To make a contribution to the SunPy code or documentation you will need to use
git and GitHub, which are the tools SunPy uses to manage changes to the code and
documentation.

1. Get a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup/free)
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) SunPy on GitHub
1. Install the developer version of SunPy using git. 
1. Make your changes and push to your fork.
1. Create a .

If any of the above steps are unfamiliar to you check out our
[Developers Guide](http://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/dev.html). (Suggesting
improvements to the developers guide is an excellent way to contribute!)


## Pull Request Review

When you submit a pull request it can be reviewed and commented on by anyone.
Everyone's contributions are reviewed, and no-one's contributions are accepted
in to SunPy without being reviewed. We do this to try to maintain a consistent
coding style and high quality code.

For the code to be accepted into SunPy it must meet the following criteria:

* Conform to code quality standards, primarily [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* Have close to 100% unit test coverage (see [testing](http://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/dev.html#testing)).
* Have API documentation generated by astropy's automodapi extenstion where appropriate.
* Contain an entry in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file.
* Be approved by at least two SunPy contributors.

When a Pull Request is submitted to SunPy a set of automated checks are run to
ensure that there are adequate tests which pass and PEP 8 is adhered to.


## Pull Requests to non-master Branches

From time to time, large feature development work may occur in branches other than master, and all 
maintained releases currently have a branch i.e. `0.6`.
When making a PR to one of these branches (not master), please put the name of the branch in square brackets at 
the beginning of the PR, i.e. `[0.6] My bug fix`. This makes it easier to filter and review these PRs on GitHub.
