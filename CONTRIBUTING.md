How to contrubute to SunPy
--------------------------

Hello, and thanks for being interested in contributing to SunPy!

SunPy is an open project that enourages everyone to contribute in any way possible.
This document mainly focuses on code or documentation contributions, however
there are many other ways to get involved with the SunPy community, a good place
to start is saying hello on the [mailinglist]() or [IRC]().


## Reporting Issues

If you have found a problem when using SunPy the best way to report it and get
some help is by opening an [issue](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues) on our
GitHub issue tracker.

A good issue will provide instructions and a code sample on how someone else can
reproduce your problem, so that we can fix it. For a reasonably good example see
issue [#1191](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues/1191).


## Finding Things to Contribute to

If you want to contribute to SunPy but don't know where to start, we maintain a
list of issues that are good as a starting place, these can be found under the
[package-novice](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apackage-novice)
label.


## Making a Code or Documentation Contribution

To make a contribution to the SunPy code or documentation you will need to use
git and GitHub, which are the tools SunPy uses to manage changes to the code and
documentation.

1. Get a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup/free)
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) SunPy on GitHub
1. Install the developer version of SunPy using git. 
1. Make your changes and push to your fork.
1. Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

If any of the above steps are alien to you check out our
[Developers Guide](http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/dev.html). (Suggesting
improvements to the developers guide is an excellent way to contribute!!)


## Pull Request Review

When you submit a pull request it can be reviewed and commented on by anyone.
For the code to be accepted into SunPy it must meet the following criteria:

* Conform to code quality standards, primarily [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* Have close to 100% unit test coverage (see [testing](http://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/dev.html#testing)).
* Have API documentation generated by astropy's automodapi extenstion where appropriate.
* Contain an entry in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file.
* Be approved by at least two SunPy contributors.


## Pull Requests to non-master Branches

From time to time, large feature development work may occur in branches other than master, and all 
maintained releases currently have a branch i.e. `0.6`.
When making a PR to one of these branches (not master), please put the name of the branch in square brackets at 
the beginning of the PR, i.e. `[0.6] My bug fix`. This makes it easier to filter and review these PRs.
