The SunPy project is happy to announce the release of SunPy 0.9.0.

SunPy v0.9.0 contains 807 commits in 147 merged pull requests closing 310
issues from 31 people, 19 of which are first time contributors to SunPy.

This release introduces a rewritten JSOC client and various other improvements
to the library.  This release will be the last in the 0.x series of releases,
with the next release planned to be v1.0.  This release will be the last major
version to support Python 2, and will also be the last version to include
``sunpy.spectra``, ``sunpy.lightcurve`` and ``sunpy.wcs``, all of which were
deprecated in 0.8.

We will be supporting bug fixes to the 0.9 release until the end of life of
Python 2, which is 1st Jan 2020.

In addition to the contributions to the core SunPy library, we would like to
thank Kolja Glogowski for his help with the JSOC project, and welcome his
package 'drms' as a SunPy affiliated package, which is now powering our JSOC
client.  Finally, we would like to thank David Pérez-Suárez and Brigitta Sipocz,
who are leading the GSOC process for OpenAstronomy, which is of massive benefit
to the SunPy community.
