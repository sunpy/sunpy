This release introduces a rewritten JSOC client and various other improvements to the library.
This release will be the last in the 0.x series of releases, with the next release planned to be v1.0.
This release will be the last major version to support Python 2, and will also be the last version to include ``sunpy.spectra``, ``sunpy.lightcurve`` and ``sunpy.wcs``, all of which were

In addition to the contributions to the core SunPy library, we would like to thank Kolja Glogowski for his help with the JSOC project, and welcome his package 'drms' as a SunPy affiliated package, which is now powering our JSOC client.
Finally, we would like to thank David Pérez-Suárez and Brigitta Sipocz, who are leading the GSOC process for OpenAstronomy, which is of massive benefit to the SunPy community.
