The SunPy project is happy to announce the release of SunPy 1.1!
SunPy is an open-source Python library for Solar Physics data analysis and visualization.

This release is our first major release post-1.0 and part of our new `release pattern <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/blob/master/SEP-0009.md>`__.

The major highlights of this release are:

* The `~sunpy.coordinates` subpackage now supports four additional coordinate frames (HCI, HEE, GSE, and GEI).
* A new subpackage `sunpy.data.data_manager` has been added to support versioned data for functions and methods.
* Support in `sunpy.map` and `sunpy.net` for the SUVI instrument on GOES satellites.
* Initial support for WISPR data from Parker Solar Probe in `sunpy.map`.
* The import times for `sunpy` and some subpackages are significantly shorter, with no loss of functionality.
