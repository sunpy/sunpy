  #   1. >=2.0.x is the numpy requirement for wheel builds for distribution
  #      on PyPI - building against 2.x yields wheels that are also
  #      ABI-compatible with numpy 1.x at runtime.
  #   2. Note that building against numpy 1.x works fine too - users and
  #      redistributors can do this by installing the numpy version they like
  #      and disabling build isolation.
  #   3. The <2.3 upper bound is for matching the numpy deprecation policy,
  #      it should not be loosened.
