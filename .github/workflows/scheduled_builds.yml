# Due to a limitation of Github Actions where the `schedule` trigger
# only applies to the default branch, we need a way of triggering the
# jobs on the other branches.
# To do this we use a WORKFLOW_TOKEN which is a PAT for the bot account with workflow_dispatch permissions.
# Therefore, this workflow triggers on main, and dispatches to other branches.
