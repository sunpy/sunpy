Example Gallery
===============

The purpose of the page is to describe the contribution guidelines for the
`SunPy Example Gallery <http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/generated/gallery/index.html>`_.
All potential contributors to the SunPy Example Gallery should read and abide by
the following guidelines.

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

-  The title of the example should be short yet descriptive and emphasize the goal of the example. Try to make the title appeal to a broad audience and avoid referencing a specific instrument, catalog, or anything wavelength dependent.
-  Each example should begin with a paragraph that gives a brief overview of the entire example, including relevant astronomy concepts, and motivates the described functionality.
-  The examples must be compatible with the versions supported by the last major release of the SunPy core package (i.e. Python >= 3.6).
-  All the examples must be fully PEP8 compliant, we recommend using one of the many PEP8 linters that are available (autopep8, pylint, flake8 as some examples).
-  Wherever possible, the examples should include linked references with links pointing to the appropriate DOI or ADS entry.
-  The example should include links to relevant documentation pages.
-  Each example should, where possible, include at least one image, map, or plot to use as the icon in the Example Gallery.
-  The examples should avoid using acronyms without defining them first (e.g. Virtual Solar Observatory, or VSO). Similarly complex jargon should be avoided unless clearly explained.
-  There should be a good variety of examples for each section (simple and more complex to cater for different levels).
