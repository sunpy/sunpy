Dependency Support Policy
*************************

.. note::

    This policy is based on `NEP-0029`_.

sunpy has a short list of core dependencies (Python, numpy, astropy, parfive) and a long list of optional dependencies.
The minimum version of these packages that we enforce follows this policy.

* Python: Released in the prior 42 months from the anticipated release date.
* astropy: Released in the prior 12 months from the anticipated release date.
* Everything else: Released in the prior 24 months from the anticipated release date.

Sponsored affiliated packages will support *at least* the sunpy LTS version at the time of their release.
