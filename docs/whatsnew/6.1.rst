*Add release stats here.*

Updates to minimum dependencies
===============================

The minimum required versions of the following packages have been updated:

- matplotlib>=3.6.0

Additional new map dependency
=============================

With the addition of the ``contourpy`` package, the following new dependency has been added:

- contourpy>=1.0.1

This unifies the contour plotting within `sunpy.map.GenericMap`, :meth`sunpy.map.GenericMap.contour` to be the same as :meth`sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_contours`.
This is package is already a dependency of ``matplotlib``, so no additional installation steps are required.
