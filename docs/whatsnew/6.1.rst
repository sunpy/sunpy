Updates to minimum dependencies
===============================

The minimum required versions of the following packages have been updated:

- astropy>=6.0.0
- matplotlib>=3.6.0
- numpy>=1.24.0
- pandas>=1.5.0
- sphinx>=6.0.0

Support for helioprojective radial coordinates and maps
=======================================================

Helioprojective radial (HPR) coordinates are now supported using the `~sunpy.coordinates.HelioprojectiveRadial` coordinate frame, and HPR FITS files are also supported.
Per the FITS WCS machinery, the impact-angle component (``theta``) is replaced by the a declination component (``delta``) by subtracting 90 degrees from ``theta``.
An HPR coordinate has a ``theta`` property to quickly obtain the impact angle, and there is a visualization helper function (:func:`~sunpy.visualization.show_hpr_impact_angle`) to modify a plot axis.
Finally, there is a helper function (:func:`~sunpy.map.make_hpr_header`) to create HPR FITS headers.

Additional new map dependency
=============================

With the addition of the ``contourpy`` package, the following new dependency has been added:

- contourpy>=1.0.1

This unifies the contour plotting within `sunpy.map.GenericMap`, :meth`sunpy.map.GenericMap.contour` to be the same as :meth`sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_contours`.
This is package is already a dependency of ``matplotlib``, so no additional installation steps are required.

Support for Reading from Remote Filesysytems
============================================

Support has been added to ``sunpy.map.Map`` and ``sunpy.timeseries.TimeSeries`` to read files from remote filesystems using the `fsspec <https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io>`__ library.

Support for S3 filesystems is tested, but other fsspec plugins should work for most filetypes, please open issues if errors are encountered with other filesystems.

You will need to install packages for your desired filesystem so for S3 the ``s3fs`` package needs to be installed (use ``pip install sunpy[all,s3]`` or ``conda install sunpy s3fs boto3`` boto3 is currently needed for reading CDF files).

Drawing the extent of a WCS
===========================

The extent of any WCS with two celestial axes can now be drawn on a `~astropy.visualization.wcsaxes.WCSAxes` using
:func:`sunpy.visualization.drawing.extent`.
Additionally, :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_extent` has been added as a convenience method for drawing the
extent of any map.
