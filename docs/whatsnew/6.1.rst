``sunpy`` 6.1 also includes a large number of smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the :ref:`changelog`.

*Add release stats here.*

Updates to minimum dependencies
===============================

The minimum required versions of the following packages have been updated:

- matplotlib>=3.6.0

Additional new map dependency
=============================

With the addition of the ``contourpy`` package, the following new dependency has been added:

- contourpy>=1.0.1

This unifies the contour plotting within `sunpy.map.GenericMap`, :meth`sunpy.map.GenericMap.contour` to be the same as :meth`sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_contours`.
This is package is already a dependency of ``matplotlib``, so no additional installation steps are required.

Support for Reading from Remote Filesysytems
============================================

Support has been added to ``sunpy.map.Map`` and ``sunpy.timeseries.TimeSeries`` to read files from remote filesystems using the `fsspec <https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io>`__ library.

Support for S3 filesystems is tested, but other fsspec plugins should work for most filetypes, please open issues if errors are encountered with other filesystems.

You will need to install packages for your desired filesystem so for S3 the ``s3fs`` package needs to be installed (use ``pip install sunpy[all,s3]`` or ``conda install sunpy s3fs boto3`` boto3 is currently needed for reading CDF files).
