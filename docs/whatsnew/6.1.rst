*Add release stats here.*

Updates to minimum dependencies
===============================

The minimum required versions of the following packages have been updated:

- matplotlib>=3.6.0

Support for helioprojective radial coordinates and maps
=======================================================

Helioprojective radial (HPR) coordinates are now supported using the `~sunpy.coordinates.HelioprojectiveRadial` coordinate frame, and HPR FITS files are also supported.
Per the FITS WCS machinery, the impact-angle component (``theta``) is replaced by the a declination component (``delta``) by subtracting 90 degrees from ``theta``.
An HPR coordinate has a ``theta`` property to quickly obtain the impact angle, and there is a visualization helper function (:func:`~sunpy.visualization.show_hpr_impact_angle`) to modify a plot axis.
Finally, there is a helper function (:func:`~sunpy.map.make_hpr_header`) to create HPR FITS headers.

Additional new map dependency
=============================

With the addition of the ``contourpy`` package, the following new dependency has been added:

- contourpy>=1.0.1

This unifies the contour plotting within `sunpy.map.GenericMap`, :meth`sunpy.map.GenericMap.contour` to be the same as :meth`sunpy.map.GenericMap.draw_contours`.
This is package is already a dependency of ``matplotlib``, so no additional installation steps are required.
