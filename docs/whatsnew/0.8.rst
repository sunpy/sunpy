New coordinate package
======================

Spatial locations are now represented by SunPy coordinates.
Coordinates can be defined very simply::

    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    >>> from sunpy.coordinates import frames
    >>> a = SkyCoord(200*u.arcsec, 300*u.arcsec, frame=frames.Helioprojective)
    >>> a
    <SkyCoord (Helioprojective: obstime=None, rsun=695508.0 km, observer=earth): (Tx, Ty) in arcsec
    ( 200.,  300.)>
    >>> b = SkyCoord(-20*u.degree, -56*u.degree, frame=frames.HeliographicStonyhurst)
    >>> b
    <SkyCoord (HeliographicStonyhurst: obstime=None): (lon, lat, radius) in (deg, deg, km)
    (-20., -56.,  695508.)>


The coordinate "a" is in the helioprojective coordinate system, and the coordinate "b"
is in the heliographic Stonyhurst system.

Maps can also be used define coordinate frames::

    >>> import sunpy.map
    >>> import sunpy.data.sample
    >>> aia_map = sunpy.map.Map(sunpy.data.sample.AIA_171_IMAGE)
    >>> c = SkyCoord(-45*u.arcsec, 600*u.arcsec, frame=aia_map.coordinate_frame)
    >>> c
    <SkyCoord (Helioprojective: obstime=2011-06-07 06:33:02.770000, rsun=696000000.0 m, observer=<HeliographicStonyhurst Coordinate (obstime=None): (lon, lat, radius) in (deg, deg, m)
    ( 0.,  0.048591,   1.51846026e+11)>): (Tx, Ty) in arcsec
    (-45.,  600.)>

The coordinate "c" is now defined with respect to the coordinate frame derived from the map.
The observer attribute::

    >>> c.observer
    <HeliographicStonyhurst Coordinate (obstime=None): (lon, lat, radius) in (deg, deg, m)
    ( 0.,  0.048591,   1.51846026e+11)>

defines the location from which the coordinate was observed.


Transformation between solar physics coordinate systems
-------------------------------------------------------

Transformation between solar physics coordinate frames is simple::

    >>> c.transform_to(frames.HeliographicStonyhurst)
    <SkyCoord (HeliographicStonyhurst: obstime=2011-06-07 06:33:02.770000): (lon, lat, radius) in (deg, deg, km)
    (-3.51257477,  39.27459767,  696000.00000088)>

Transformation to astropy coordinate systems
--------------------------------------------

Solar physics coordinates can also be transformed into astrophysical coordinates::

    >>>



Specification of observer at any major solar system body
