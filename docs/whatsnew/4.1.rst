Extracting Values from a `~sunpy.map.GenericMap` Along a Set of Coordinates
===========================================================================
It is now easy to extract data values from a `~sunpy.map.GenericMap` along
a curve specified by set of coordinates using the new
`sunpy.map.extract_along_coord` function.
This is done by applying `Bresenham's line algorithm <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm>`_
between the consecutive coordinates, in pixel space, and then indexing the data
array of the map at those points.
See :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_gallery_units_and_coordinates_map_slit_extraction.py` for an example.
