Deprecating ``sunpy.database``
==============================
The sunpy.database module is no longer actively maintained and has a number of outstanding issues.
It is anticiapted that sunpy.database will be formally deprecated in sunpy 5.0 and removed in sunpy 6.0.
If you are using sunpy.database and would like to see a replacement, please join the discussion thread at https://community.openastronomy.org/t/deprecating-sunpy-database/495.

Extracting Values from a `~sunpy.map.GenericMap` Along a Set of Coordinates
===========================================================================
It is now easy to extract data values from a `~sunpy.map.GenericMap` along
a curve specified by set of coordinates using the new
`sunpy.map.extract_along_coord` function.
This is done by applying `Bresenham's line algorithm <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm>`_
between the consecutive coordinates, in pixel space, and then indexing the data
array of the map at those points.
See :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_gallery_units_and_coordinates_map_slit_extraction.py` for an example.

Drawing the solar equator and prime meridian
============================================
You can now use the `sunpy.visualization.drawing` module to draw the solar equator
and prime meridian (zero Carrington longitude) on Astropy WCS axes.

Deprecation of ``sunpy.visualization.limb``
===========================================
The ``sunpy.visualization.limb`` module is deprecated and will be removed in
version 5.1. The ``sunpy.visualization.limb.draw_limb`` function has been moved into
the `sunpy.visualization.drawing` module and renamed :func:`sunpy.visualization.drawing.limb`.

Changes to timeseries plotting
==============================
In order to make plotting a timeseries as source-independent as possible, we have removed a
number of source-specific plot customisations in ``peek()`` and ``plot()`` methods.
See the changelog for more details on what has changed.

In order to harmonise different ``peek()`` and ``plot()`` signatures, all non-keyword arguments to these methods are deprecated.
To avoid a warning pass all arguments with keywords (e.g. ``plot(title='my plot title')``) instead.

``parfive`` 2.0.0 release
=========================
A recent update (2.0.0) to ``parfive`` adds several features and we would encourage users to upgrade to it.

This comes with major usability improvements: removal of incomplete files and major error reporting upgrades.
We believe it will have an impact on how people experience downloading files.

To upgrade you can use pip::

    pip install -U parfive

or conda::

    conda update parfive
