Deprecating ``sunpy.database``
==============================
The sunpy.database module is no longer actively maintained and has a number of outstanding issues.
It is anticiapted that sunpy.database will be formally deprecated in sunpy 5.0 and removed in sunpy 6.0.
If you are using sunpy.database and would like to see a replacement, please join the discussion thread at https://community.openastronomy.org/t/deprecating-sunpy-database/495.

Extracting Values from a `~sunpy.map.GenericMap` Along a Set of Coordinates
===========================================================================
It is now easy to extract data values from a `~sunpy.map.GenericMap` along a curve specified by set of coordinates using the new `sunpy.map.extract_along_coord` function.
This is done by applying `Bresenham's line algorithm <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm>`__ between the consecutive coordinates, in pixel space, and then indexing the data array of the map at those points.
See :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_gallery_units_and_coordinates_map_slit_extraction.py` for an example.

Easier reprojecting to Carrington and Stonyhurst coordinates
============================================================
``sunpy.map.header_helper`` has a new :func:`~sunpy.map.header_helper.make_heliographic_header` function that simplifies creating map headers that span the whole solar surface in Carrington or Stonyhurst coordinates.
When used in combination with :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.reproject_to` this greatly simplifies reprojecting helioprojective maps into heliographic full-Sun maps.

Drawing the solar equator and prime meridian
============================================
You can now use the `sunpy.visualization.drawing` module to draw the solar equator and prime meridian (zero Carrington longitude) on Astropy WCS axes.

.. minigallery:: sunpy.visualization.drawing.equator

Deprecation of ``sunpy.visualization.limb``
===========================================
The ``sunpy.visualization.limb`` module is deprecated and will be removed in version 5.1.
The ``sunpy.visualization.limb.draw_limb`` function has been moved into the `sunpy.visualization.drawing` module and renamed :func:`sunpy.visualization.drawing.limb`.

Changes to timeseries plotting
==============================
In order to make plotting a timeseries as source-independent as possible, we have removed a number of source-specific plot customisations in ``peek()`` and ``plot()`` methods.
See the changelog for more details on what has changed.

In order to harmonize different ``peek()`` and ``plot()`` signatures, all non-keyword arguments to these methods are deprecated.
To avoid a warning pass all arguments with keywords (e.g. ``plot(title='my plot title')``) instead.

Deprecation of ``HelioviewerClient``
====================================
The Helioviewer Project now maintains a Python Wrapper called `hvpy <https://hvpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
As such, in consultation with the Helioviewer Project, we have decided to deprecate the ``HelioviewerClient`` class.
The ``sunpy.net.helioviewer`` module is deprecated and will be removed in version 5.1.

``parfive`` 2.0.0 release
=========================
A recent update (2.0.0) to ``parfive`` adds several features and we would encourage users to upgrade to it.

This comes with major usability improvements: removal of incomplete files and major error reporting upgrades.
We believe it will have an impact on how people experience downloading files.

To upgrade you can use pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -U parfive

or conda:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda update parfive
