.. _whatsnew-2.0-pixels:

Fixes and clarification to pixel indexing
=========================================

sunpy uses zero-based indexing when referring to pixels, where the center of
the bottom left pixel of a map is at ``[0, 0] * u.pix``. Several parts of the
API have been updated to make sure this is consistently the case across the
pacakge. In particular:

- `sunpy.map.GenericMap.top_right_coord` previously had an off-by-one error
  in the calculation of the top right coordinate. This has been fixed.
- `sunpy.map.GenericMap.center` previously had an off-by-one error
  in the calculation of the coordinate of the center of a map. This has been fixed.
- `sunpy.map.GenericMap.reference_pixel` now returns a zero-based reference
  pixel. This is one pixel less than the previously returned value. Note that
  this means the ``reference_pixel`` now does **not** have the same value as the
  FITS ``CRPIX`` values, which are one-based indices.
