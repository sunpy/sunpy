************************
What's New in SunPy 1.0?
************************

Overview
========

The SunPy project is pleased to announce the 1.0 release of the sunpy package.
This release is the result of over 14 months of work and marks a shift in the core library with the removal of a lot of legacy code and a focus on usability and stability.
The headline changes in 1.0 are:

* A complete transition of the whole code base to use `astropy.time.Time`, which was implemented by Vishnunarayan K I as part of Google Summer of Code 2018.
* A rewrite of how all the clients in `sunpy.net` download files from the internet.
  This means vastly improved progress bars, skipping downloads if files are present, and better visibility and retrying of failed downloads.
* A rewrite of the differential rotation and image warping code to correctly account for observer location using the Astropy coordinate functionality.
* Removal of many deprecated functions and submodules; we have used the 1.0 release as a chance to clean out SunPy, reducing the number of lines of Python code in the package by almost 3,000!
* The first release of SunPy to be Python 3 only, requiring Python 3.6+.  This is because Python 2 `will not be maintained after 2019 <https://python3statement.org/>`__.

On this page, you can read about some of the big changes in this release:

.. _whatsnew-1.0-python:

Supported versions of Python
============================

SunPy 1.0 has dropped Python 2 support as Python 2 is nearing the end of its support cycle.
To port your code to Python 3, there is some good advice `here <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html>`__ and a
breakdown of the relevant changes in Python 3 on the `Python 3 for Scientists <https://python-3-for-scientists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
page. If you still need Python 2 support, SunPy 0.9.X will see bug fixes until the end of 2019, but no new features. As a result,
SunPy's minimum Python version has been raised to Python 3.6 and is routinely tested against Python 3.6 and 3.7.

.. _whatsnew-1.0-time:

Astropy Time is used everywhere
===============================

SunPy now uses Astropy's `~astropy.time.Time` object everywhere to represent time.
This comes with numerous benefits:

- **Support for non-UTC time scales.**
  UTC as well as non-UTC time scales like TAI, TT, UT1 etc. can be used with `astropy.time.Time`.

  .. code:: python

      >>> t = Time('2012-06-18T02:00:05.453', scale='tai')
      >>> t
      <Time object: scale='tai' format='isot' value=2012-06-18T02:00:05.453>

  `~astropy.time.Time` also provides easy conversion between different scales.

  .. code:: python

      >>> t.utc
      <Time object: scale='utc' format='isot' value=2012-06-18T01:59:31.453>

- **Support for high precision times.**
  `~astropy.time.Time` can provide sub-nanosecond precision for time objects while python
  `datetime` was restricted to microseconds.

  .. code:: python

    >>> t = Time('2012-06-18T02:00:05.453123123')
    >>> t
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='isot' value=2012-06-18T02:00:05.453>
    >>> t.precision = 9
    >>> t
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='isot' value=2012-06-18T02:00:05.453123123>

- **Support for leap seconds**
  This was one of the biggest motivations for the transition to `astropy.time.Time`.
  `datetime` has no support for leap seconds while `~astropy.time.Time` supports them.
  A leap second is a one-second adjustment applied to UTC to keep it close to the mean solar time.

  .. code:: python

    >>> Time('2016-12-31T23:59:60')
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='isot' value=2016-12-31T23:59:60.000>
    >>> Time('2016-12-31T23:59:59') + 1 * u.s
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='isot' value=2016-12-31T23:59:60.000>

- **Support for numerous formats**
  `~astropy.time.Time` can parse numerous formats including python `datetime`.

  .. code:: python

    >>> list(Time.FORMATS)
    ['jd', 'mjd', 'decimalyear', 'unix', 'cxcsec', 'gps', 'plot_date', 'datetime', 'iso', 'isot', 'yday', 'fits', 'byear', 'jyear', 'byear_str', 'jyear_str']

  .. code:: python

    >>> import datetime
    >>> Time(datetime.datetime.now())
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='datetime' value=2018-10-20 15:36:16.364089>

- **Changes in return values**

  All functions which previously returned `datetime.datetime` now return `~astropy.time.Time` and all functions which returned `datetime.timedelta` now return `astropy.time.TimeDelta`.
  For example, the properties of `sunpy.time.TimeRange` which  used to return `datetime.datetime` and `datetime.timedelta` now return `astropy.time.Time` and `astropy.time.TimeDelta`.

- **Changes to** `~sunpy.time.parse_time`

  `~sunpy.time.parse_time` has been reduced to a tiny wrapper over `~astropy.time.Time`.
  The API of `~sunpy.time.parse_time` is almost the same as `~astropy.time.Time`, however, `~sunpy.time.parse_time` supports conversion of a few more formats than `~astropy.time.Time`, which
  are `numpy.datetime64`, `pandas.Series`, `pandas.DatetimeIndex`, utime and a few other time string formats.


.. _whatsnew-1.0-download:

Improved file downloading capability
====================================

The file download capability has been re-written to use the `parfive package <https://github.com/Cadair/parfive>`__.
This brings more visually appealing and informative progress bars, better reporting of download errors and the ability to
re-download failed files.

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1391051/50290236-ecf07b00-0462-11e9-80b2-9473c918802a.gif

   :alt: Parfive progress bars in a terminal


It is possible to retry any downloads which fail with::

  >>> files = Fido.fetch(results)  # Some downloads fail
  >>> files = Fido.fetch(files)  # Retry the downloads which failed


.. _whatsnew-1.0-coordinates:

Improvements to coordinates functionality
=========================================

- **Accurate Sun-specific coordinates calculations**

  Sun-specific coordinates calculations have been grouped together in `sunpy.coordinates.sun`, and the underlying implementations have been re-written to use Astropy rather than approximate expressions.
  Nearly all of the returned values now match published values in the *Astronomical Almanac* to published precision (e.g., the hundredth of an arcsecond for apparent right ascension).
  For times that are provided to these functions, the user should take care to specify whether the time is other than UT (e.g., TT), which can be done using `~astropy.time.Time` (see above).

- **Improved tools to get positions of bodies in the solar system**

  The existing function `~sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris.get_body_heliographic_stonyhurst` has been enhanced to be able to correct for light travel time.
  When one specifies an observer, the function determines the emission time in the past that results in photons arriving at the observer at the observation time.
  The function then returns the location of the requested body at that emission time.

  .. code:: python

    >>> t = '2012-06-05 22:34:48.350'

    >>> without_correction = get_body_heliographic_stonyhurst('venus', t)
    >>> print(without_correction)
    <HeliographicStonyhurst Coordinate (obstime=2012-06-05T22:34:48.350): (lon, lat, radius) in (deg, deg, AU)
        (359.92620234, 0.02752007, 0.72602872)>

    >>> with_correction = get_body_heliographic_stonyhurst('venus', t, observer=get_earth(t))
    INFO: Apparent body location accounts for 144.06 seconds of light travel time [sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris]
    >>> print(with_correction)
    <HeliographicStonyhurst Coordinate (obstime=2012-06-05T22:34:48.350): (lon, lat, radius) in (deg, deg, AU)
        (359.92355609, 0.02734159, 0.72602853)>

  There is a new function `~sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris.get_horizons_coord` that queries `JPL HORIZONS <https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons>`__ for the location of solar-system bodies.
  JPL HORIZONS includes not only planets and other natural bodies in the solar system, but also major spacecraft.
  This function requires the `Astroquery <https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ package and an Internet connection.


  - Query the location of Venus

  .. code:: python

    >>> get_horizons_coord('Venus barycenter', '2001-02-03 04:05:06')  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    INFO: Obtained JPL HORIZONS location for Venus Barycenter (2) [sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris]
    <SkyCoord (HeliographicStonyhurst: obstime=2001-02-03T04:05:06.000): (lon, lat, radius) in (deg, deg, AU)
        (326.06844114, -1.64998481, 0.71915147)>

  - Query the location of the SDO spacecraft

  .. code:: python

    >>> get_horizons_coord('SDO', '2011-11-11 11:11:11')  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    INFO: Obtained JPL HORIZONS location for Solar Dynamics Observatory (spac [sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris]
    <SkyCoord (HeliographicStonyhurst: obstime=2011-11-11T11:11:11.000): (lon, lat, radius) in (deg, deg, AU)
        (0.01018888, 3.29640407, 0.99011042)>

  - Query the location of the SOHO spacecraft via its ID number (-21)

  .. code:: python

    >>> get_horizons_coord(-21, '2004-05-06 11:22:33', 'id')  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    INFO: Obtained JPL HORIZONS location for SOHO (spacecraft) (-21) [sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris]
    <SkyCoord (HeliographicStonyhurst: obstime=2004-05-06T11:22:33.000): (lon, lat, radius) in (deg, deg, AU)
        (0.2523461, -3.55863351, 0.99923086)>


.. _whatsnew-1.0-logging:

Logging used to record SunPy notices
====================================

All messages provided by SunPy use a new logging facility which is based on the Python logging module rather than print statements.

Messages can have one of several levels, in increasing order of importance:

* DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
* INFO: A message conveying information about the current task, and confirming that things are working as expected.
* WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, and that user action may be required.
* ERROR: An indication that a more serious issue has occured, where something failed but the task is continuing.
* CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

By default, all messages except for DEBUG messages are displayed. Messages can also be sent to a file and time stamped.

See the :ref:`logger` documentation for instructions on how to control the verbosity of the logger.


.. _whatsnew-1.0-diffrot:

Improvements to differential rotation
=====================================

Applying the effect of solar differential rotation to coordinates now properly takes into account the changing position of the observer.
For example, since the Earth moves, observers on the Earth must take into account the solar differential rotation of the Sun and the motion of the Earth when calculating a location on the Sun.

- **Support for applying solar differential rotation to coordinates.**

  Solar differential rotation of on-disk coordinates can be specified using either time or a new observer.
  If time is specified, then the new observer is assumed to be located on the Earth::

    >>> import astropy.units as u
    >>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    >>> from sunpy.coordinates import Helioprojective
    >>> from sunpy.physics.differential_rotation import solar_rotate_coordinate
    >>> from sunpy.time import parse_time

    >>> start_time = '2010-09-10 12:34:56'
    >>> duration = 25*u.hour
    >>> c = SkyCoord(-570*u.arcsec, 120*u.arcsec, obstime=start_time, frame=Helioprojective)
    >>> solar_rotate_coordinate(c, time=duration)
    <SkyCoord (Helioprojective: obstime=2010-09-11T13:34:56.000, rsun=695700.0 km, observer=<HeliographicStonyhurst Coordinate (obstime=2010-09-11T13:34:56.000): (lon, lat, radius) in (deg, deg, AU)
        (-5.08888749e-14, 7.24318962, 1.00669016)>): (Tx, Ty, distance) in (arcsec, arcsec, km)
        (-363.04027419, 104.87807178, 1.499598e+08)>

  Due to the ellipticity of the Earth's orbit, the amount of solar rotation is different at different times in the year::

    >>> start_time = '2010-06-10 12:34:56'
    >>> duration = 25*u.hour
    >>> c = SkyCoord(-570*u.arcsec, 120*u.arcsec, obstime=start_time, frame=Helioprojective)
    >>> solar_rotate_coordinate(c, time=duration)
    <SkyCoord (Helioprojective: obstime=2010-06-10T12:34:56.000, rsun=695700.0 km, observer=<HeliographicStonyhurst Coordinate (obstime=2010-06-11T13:34:56.000): (lon, lat, radius) in (deg, deg, AU)
        (0., 0.58398742, 1.01539908)>): (Tx, Ty, distance) in (arcsec, arcsec, km)
        (-359.11576773, 117.18020622, 1.51263627e+08)>


  The user can also explicitly specify an observer at a different time and location in space.  The amount of solar
  rotation applied depends on the time difference between the observation time of the`~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord`
  and the time of the observer::

    >>> import astropy.units as u
    >>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    >>> from sunpy.coordinates import Helioprojective, HeliographicStonyhurst
    >>> from sunpy.physics.differential_rotation import solar_rotate_coordinate
    >>> from sunpy.time import parse_time

    >>> start_time = parse_time('2010-06-10 12:34:56')
    >>> duration = 25*u.hour
    >>> c = SkyCoord(-570*u.arcsec, 120*u.arcsec, obstime=start_time, frame=Helioprojective)
    >>> new_observer = SkyCoord(lon=20*u.deg, lat=8*u.deg, radius=0.9*u.au, obstime=end_time, frame=HeliographicStonyhurst)
    >>> solar_rotate_coordinate(c, observer=new_observer)
    <SkyCoord (Helioprojective: obstime=2010-06-10T12:34:56.000, rsun=695700.0 km, observer=<HeliographicStonyhurst Coordinate (obstime=2010-06-11T13:34:56.000): (lon, lat, radius) in (deg, deg, AU)
        (20., 8., 0.9)>): (Tx, Ty, distance) in (arcsec, arcsec, km)
        (-715.77862011, 31.87928146, 1.34122226e+08)>

- **Experimental support for applying solar differential rotation to maps.**

  Applying solar differential rotation to maps also accounts for changing observer position.
  This functionality is still experimental.
  For example, to differentially rotate a map back 23 hours::

  >>> import astropy.units as u
  >>> import sunpy.map
  >>> from sunpy.data.sample import AIA_171_IMAGE
  >>> from sunpy.physics.differential_rotation import differential_rotate

  >>> aia = sunpy.map.Map(AIA_171_IMAGE)
  >>> differential_rotate(aia, time=-23*u.hour)

  `~sunpy.physics.differential_rotation.differential_rotate` also accepts a new observer keyword.
  The amount of solar differential rotation is calculated using the time difference between the map date and observation time of the new observer.
  For example::

  >>> import astropy.units as u
  >>> import sunpy.map
  >>> from sunpy.data.sample import AIA_171_IMAGE

  >>> from sunpy.physics.differential_rotation import differential_rotate
  >>> aia = sunpy.map.Map(AIA_171_IMAGE)
  >>> new_observer = SkyCoord(lon=-15*u.deg, lat=-4*u.deg, radius=1*u.au, obstime=aia.date-34*u.hour, frame=HeliographicStonyhurst)
  >>> differential_rotate(aia, observer=new_observer)

.. _whatsnew-1.0-maputils:

Map utility functions
=====================

A set of new utility functions have been added to `sunpy.map` which act on `sunpy.map.GenericMap` instances.

For example, getting the world coordinates for every pixel::

    >>> import sunpy.map
    >>> from sunpy.data.sample import AIA_171_IMAGE
    >>> import astropy.units as u
    >>> from sunpy.physics.differential_rotation import differential_rotate
    >>> from sunpy.map import contains_full_disk, all_coordinates_from_map

    >>> aia = sunpy.map.Map(AIA_171_IMAGE)
    >>> contains_full_disk(aia)
    True
    >>> coordinates = all_coordinates_from_map(aia) # The coordinates for every map pixel
    >>> coordinates.shape
    (1024, 1024)


or generating a new FITS header for a custom map::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import astropy.units as u
    >>> from sunpy.coordinates import frames
    >>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord

    >>> data = np.arange(0,100).reshape(10,10)
    >>> coord = SkyCoord(0*u.arcsec, 0*u.arcsec, obstime = '2013-10-28', observer = 'earth', frame = frames.Helioprojective)
    >>> header = sunpy.map.header_helper.make_fitswcs_header(data, coord)
    >>> for key, value in header.items():
    ...     print(f"{key}: {value}")

.. _whatsnew-1.0-moved-config:

Config File Location Moved
==========================

If you have customised your :ref:`customizing-with-sunpyrc-files` you will need to move it to the new config file location.
Your old file should be in ``~/.sunpy/sunpyrc`` file and the new location, which is now platform specific, can be found by running `sunpy.print_config`.
We recommand that your take a look at the new file as available configuration options have increased.

.. _whatsnew-1.0-renamed-removed:

Renamed/removed functionality
=============================

This is just some of the renamed or removed functionality.

* ``sunpy.sun.sun`` functions have been re-implemented using Astropy for significantly improved accuracy and moved to `sunpy.coordinates.sun`.
* Removed ``sunpy.time.julian_day``, ``sunpy.time.julian_centuries``, ``sunpy.time.day_of_year``, ``sunpy.time.break_time``, ``sunpy.time.get_day``.
* Move the matplotlib animators from ``sunpy.visualisation.imageanimator`` and ``sunpy.visualization.mapcubeanimator`` to `sunpy.visualization.animator`.
* ``axis_ranges`` kwarg of ``sunpy.visualization.animator.ArrayAnimator``,
  ``sunpy.visualization.animator.ImageAnimator`` and
  ``sunpy.visualization.animator.LineAnimator`` now must be entered as ``None``,
  ``[min, max]`` or pixel edges of each array element.
* The Helioviewer client has been switched to using the newer Helioviewer API. This has meant that we have changed some of the keywords that were passed into client’s methods.
* Removed ``sunpy.net.jsoc.attrs.Time`` because it served the same purpose as ``sunpy.net.attrs.Time`` after the switch to ``astropy.time.Time``.
* The deprecated ``sunpy.lightcurve`` (replaced by `sunpy.timeseries`), ``sunpy.wcs`` and ``sunpy.spectra`` (replaced by the ``radiospectra`` package) modules have now been removed.
