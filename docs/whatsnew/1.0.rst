************************
What's New in SunPy 1.0?
************************

Overview
========

SunPy 1.0 now uses Astropy Time everywhere
This and all future versions of SunPy will support only Python 3.6 and higher.
This is because Python 2 `will not be maintained after 2019 <https://python3statement.org/>`_.
The 0.9.x series will receive bugfixes only up until the end of life of Python 2 (around 6 months).
No new functionality will be added to the 0.9.x series, which will also be the last version to include `sunpy.spectra`, `sunpy.lightcurve` and `sunpy.wcs`, all of which were deprecated in 0.8.
All new functionality will be available only in SunPy 1.0 and higher.
