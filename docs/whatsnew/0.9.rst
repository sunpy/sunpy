**************************
What's New in SunPy 0.9?
**************************

Overview
========

SunPy 0.9 brings improved support for downloading data from the JSOC
and bugfixes compared to the 0.8.x series of releases.  The 0.9.x
series will be the last series of SunPy releases to support Python 2.
This is because Python 2 will not be maintained after 2019 - see
https://pythonclock.org/.  The 0.9.x series will receive bugfix
support only up until the and of life of Python 2.  No significant new
functionality will be added to the 0.9.x series.

SunPy 1.0 and higher will support Python 3 only.  All new
functionality will be available only in SunPy 1.0 and higher.

Improvements to JSOC functionality
==============================

Provides greater access to the JSOC search capabilities by 
using the DRMS library. improves robustness, search by any JSOC prime
key, search metadata only. Search by any series::


    >>> from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

    >>> attrs_time = a.Time('2005/01/01 00:10', '2005/01/01 00:15')
    >>> result = Fido.search(attrs_time, a.Instrument('eit'))
    >>> result
    <sunpy.net.fido_factory.UnifiedResponse object at 0x7f581489bb70>
    Results from 1 Provider:

    1 Results from the VSOClient:

Data is downloaded using::

    >>> files = Fido.fetch(result)

which returns a set of filepaths to the data.
