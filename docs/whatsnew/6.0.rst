- astropy >= 5.2.0

The minimum required versions of these optional dependencies has also been updated:

- asdf >= 2.12.0
- asdf-astropy >= 0.2.0
- beautifulsoup4 >= 4.11.0
- cdflib >= 0.4.4
- dask >= 2022.5.2

- spiceypy >= 5.0.0
- tqdm >= 4.64.0
- zeep >= 4.1.0

Overhaul of the extra groups
============================

The extra groups have been overhauled to make it easier to install sunpy with only the dependencies you need.
The following extra group have been added:

- "core" - installs only the dependencies that are required to import sunpy or any of its subpackages.
- "scikit-image" - installs the ``scikit-image`` package used for image processing. This dependency is no longer included in the "image" extra group.

Additionally, the "all" extra group is a meta group that includes all optional dependencies.
The "dask" extra group has also been removed.

Removal of ``sunpy.database``
=============================

The ``sunpy.database`` module has not been actively maintained for over a year now and has a number of outstanding issues.
It has been deprecated since sunpy 4.1, and since there have been no major objections from the community since then we have completely removed ``sunpy.database`` in sunpy 6.0.
If you are interested in seeing a replacement for ``sunpy.database``, either inside ``sunpy`` or as a third-party package, please join the discussion thread at https://community.openastronomy.org/t/deprecating-sunpy-database/495.


Arguments for :meth:`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.reproject_to`
========================================================

Arguments for this method have been changed to be keyword only after the target WCS argument.
This was raising a warning since sunpy 4.1.

Removal of ``sunpy.net.helioviewer.HelioViewerClient``
======================================================

``sunpy.net.helioviewer`` has been deprecated since sunpy v4.1 and has now been removed.
Users should instead use the `hvpy <https://hvpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ package.
This package provides a Python wrapper around the Helioviewer API and is maintained by the Helioviewer Project.
The ``hvpy`` package supersedes the ``sunpy.net.helioviewer`` module.

Arguments for :meth:`sunpy.timeseries.GenericTimeSeries.peek` are now keywords only
===================================================================================

The arguments for :meth:`sunpy.timeseries.GenericTimeSeries.peek` have been changed to be keyword only.
This means that you must now specify the arguments by name, rather than by position and has been done to make the API more consistent.
This has been raising a warning since sunpy 4.1 and is now an error.

Fix filename sanitization for downloaded files from the VSO
===========================================================

The `.VSOClient` has been sanitizing filenames to ensure that they are valid on all platforms.
However, we have now fixed the sanitization to be more conservative, to follow the NFKC Unicode normalization, which is the recommended normalization for filenames on most platforms.
This now does not replace periods, does not change letter case and do not leave Unicode characters decomposed.
An example of this is that the filename ``ä`` will now be replaced with ``ä`` instead of being left out of the filename.
Another example is that the filename "aia.lev1.171A_2020_06_07T06_33_09.35Z.image_lev1.fits" used to be replaced with "aia_lev1_171a_2020_06_07t06_33_09_35z_image_lev1.fits" and now will not be.

Deprecate positional arguments in :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.plot`
===================================================================

The arguments for :meth:`sunpy.map.GenericMap.plot` have been changed to being keyword only.
Pass them as keyword arguments (e.g., ``..., title=True, ...``) instead.

Support for ADvanced Adaptive Prediction Technique (ADAPT)
==========================================================

A new map source has been added (`sunpy.map.sources.ADAPTMap`) to support the ADAPT data files.
In addition, a new client (`sunpy.net.dataretriever.ADAPTClient`) has been added to search and download ADAPT files.

Please note that there are several data arrays within the ADAPT FITS files and `~sunpy.map.Map` will, by default, try to read them all and fail.
In these cases, you must specify the header-data Pair you want to read.
For these data, it will always be the first one.
You can specify this by passing the ``hdus`` keyword argument to `~sunpy.map.Map`,

.. code-block:: python

    >>> sunpy.map.Map("adapt40311_03k012_202401020800_i00005600n1.fts.gz", hdus=0)  # doctest: +SKIP

New `~sunpy.coordinates.PlanarScreen` context manager
=====================================================

`~sunpy.coordinates.PlanarScreen` provides a context manager for interpreting 2D coordinates as being on the inside of a planar screen.
The plane goes through Sun center (or some specified distance from Sun center) and is perpendicular to the vector between the specified vantage point and Sun center.
This replaces the default assumption where 2D coordinates are mapped onto the surface of the Sun and is an alternative to `~sunpy.coordinates.SphericalScreen`.

Deprecate `~sunpy.coordinates.Helioprojective.assume_spherical_screen`
======================================================================

:func:`~sunpy.coordinates.Helioprojective.assume_spherical_screen` is now deprecated.
Equivalent functionality is now provided by :class:`~sunpy.coordinates.SphericalScreen`.
