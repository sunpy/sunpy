Removal of ``sunpy.database``
-----------------------------
The ``sunpy.database`` module has not been actively maintained for over a year now and has a number of outstanding issues.
It has been deprecated since sunpy 4.1, and since there have been no major objections from the communityu since then we have completely removed ``sunpy.database`` in sunpy 6.0.
If you are interested in seeing a replacement for ``sunpy.database``, either inside ``sunpy`` or as a third-party package, please join the discussion thread at https://community.openastronomy.org/t/deprecating-sunpy-database/495.


Arguments for :meth:`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.reproject_to`
--------------------------------------------------------

Arguments for this method have been changed to be keyword only after the target WCS argument.
This was raising a warning since sunpy 4.1.
