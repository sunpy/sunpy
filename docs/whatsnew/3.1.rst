.. _whatsnew-3.1-python:

Increase in required package versions
=====================================
We have bumped the minimum version of several packages we depend on; these are the new minimum versions for sunpy 3.1:

- astropy >= 4.2
- numpy >= 1.17.0

.. _whatsnew-3.1-map-datetime:

New WISPR map source
====================
A new map source for the WISPR instrument on Parker Solar Probe has been added.
This improves the `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.name` of the map and adds correct
information for the `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.processing_level` and
`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.exposure_time`.

Changes to map date/time handling
=================================

New date properties
-------------------
The properties `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_start`,
`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_end`, and `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_average` have
been added to be drawn from the relevant FITS metadata, if present in the map
header. These are from new keywords defined in version 4 of the FITS standard,
which have precise meanings compared to the previously ill-defined DATE-OBS.

Changes to `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date`
---------------------------------------
`sunpy.map.GenericMap.date` now looks for more metadata than just DATE-OBS.
This property can return any one of the new properties (see above) depending
on the metadata present in the map. It now draws from, in order of preference:

1. The DATE-OBS FITS keyword
2. `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_average`
3. `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_start`
4. `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_end`
5. The current time.

If DATE-OBS is present alongside DATE-AVG or DATE-BEG and DATE-END, this results
in a behaviour change to favour the new (more precisely defined) keywords.
It is recommended
to use `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_average`,
`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_start`, or `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_end`
instead if you need one of these specific times.

Addition of new time format `~sunpy.time.TimeTaiSeconds`
--------------------------------------------------------
The new `~sunpy.time.TimeTaiSeconds` format is the number of
SI seconds from 1958-01-01 00:00:00, which includes UTC leap seconds.
1958-01-01 00:00:00 is the defined time when International Atomic Time (TAI)
and Universal Time (UT) are synchronized.

This format is equivalent to the output of the SSW ``anytim2tai`` routine, and
related routines, for times after 1972-01-01.  Be aware that the SSW routines
are not written to provide valid results for times before 1972-01-01.

This format is equivalent to `~astropy.time.TimeUnixTai`, except that the epoch
is 12 years earlier.

.. _whatsnew-3.1-diffrot-context:

Propagating solar-surface coordinates in time
=============================================

There is now an easy-to-use context manager (:func:`~sunpy.coordinates.propagate_with_solar_surface`) to enable coordinate transformations to take solar rotation into account.
Normally, a coordinate refers to a point in inertial space, so transforming it to a different observation time does not move the point at all.
Under this context manager, a coordinate will be treated as if it were referring to a point on the solar surface.
Coordinate transformations with a change in observation time will automatically rotate the point in heliographic longitude for the time difference, with the amount of rotation depending on the specified differential-rotation model.
