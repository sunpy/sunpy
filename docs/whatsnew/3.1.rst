Changes to map date/time handling
=================================

New date properties
-------------------
The properties `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_start`,
`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_end`, and `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_average` have
been added to be drawn from the relevant FITS metadata, if present in the map
header. These are from new keywords defined in version 4 of the FITS standard,
which have precise meanings compared to the previously ill-defined DATE-OBS.

Changes to `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date`
---------------------------------------
`sunpy.map.GenericMap.date` now looks for more metadata than just DATE-OBS.
This property can return any one of the new properties (see above) depending
on the metadata present in the map. It now draws from, in order of preference:

1. The DATE-OBS FITS keyword
2. `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_average`
3. `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_start`
4. `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_end`
5. The current time.

If DATE-OBS is present alongside DATE-AVG or DATE-BEG and DATE-END, this results
in a behaviour change to favour the new (more precisely defined) keywords.
It is recommended
to use `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_average`,
`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_start`, or `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.date_end`
instead if you need one of these specific times.

Addition of new time format `~sunpy.time.formats.TimeTaiSeconds`
----------------------------------------------------------------
The new `~sunpy.time.formats.TimeTaiSeconds` format is the number of
SI seconds from 1958-01-01 00:00:00, which includes UTC leap seconds.
1958-01-01 00:00:00 is the defined time when International Atomic Time (TAI)
and Universal Time (UT) are synchronized.

This format is equivalent to the output of the SSW ``anytim2tai`` routine, and
related routines, for times after 1972-01-01.  Be aware that the SSW routines
are not written to provide valid results for times before 1972-01-01.

This format is equivalent to `~astropy.time.TimeUnixTai`, except that the epoch
is 12 years earlier.
