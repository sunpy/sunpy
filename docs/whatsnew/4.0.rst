SunPy 4.0 also includes a large number of smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the :ref:`changelog`.

By the numbers:

TODO: fill this in at release time.

Increase in required package versions
=====================================
We have bumped the minimum version of several packages we depend on; these are the new minimum versions:

- python >= 3.8

Improved return types of HEK queries
====================================
The 'event_endtime', 'event_starttime' and 'event_peaktime' columns in a HEK
query are now returned as `~astropy.time.Time` objects.

Better printing of metadata
===========================
Printing a `.MetaDict` now prints each entry on a new line, making it much easier to read::

  >>> from sunpy.data.sample import AIA_171_IMAGE  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
  >>> from sunpy.map import Map
  >>> m = Map(AIA_171_IMAGE)  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
  >>> print(m.meta)  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
  simple: True
  bitpix: -32
  naxis: 2
  naxis1: 1024
  naxis2: 1024
  ...

Deprecation of `sunpy.image.coalignment`
========================================
The `sunpy.image.coalignment` module has been deprecated and will be removed in version 4.1.
Users should instead use `sunkit_image.coalignment` which includes identical functionality and
an identical API.
The reason for deprecating and moving `sunpy.image.coalignment` is twofold.
First, the scope of the core `sunpy` package has increasingly narrowed, with more analysis-specific
functionality moved out to affiliated packages.
Second, the module has seen little development in several years and by moving
it to `sunkit_image.coalignment`, we hope to increase its visibility and attract a larger number
of contributors.
