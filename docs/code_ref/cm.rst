SunPy cm
========

This submodule implements solar physics specific colormaps. Upon import these
colormaps are registered with matplotlib, so they can be used as if they were
built in.

A preview of all the SunPy colormaps is shown below:

.. plot::

   import sunpy.cm

   sunpy.cm.show_colormaps()
