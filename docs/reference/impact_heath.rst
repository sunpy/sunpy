Impact and Health
#################

The figures on this page give a sense of the level of impact the ``sunpy`` codebase has on the solar physics community and research in the field, as well as the amount of development effort contributed over time (the codebase's "health").
Assessments of The SunPy Project's engagement with the diverse solar physics community are an equally important but we got not data.

Concerning the codebase, a major positive trend is that citations to ``sunpy``, as a proxy for its usage in research, have been consistently growing since The SunPy Project was created.
However, the amount of developer resources has remained small, with a limited number of volunteer maintainers met with an increasing amount of development responsibility.
Hence, we welcome any help that you can give!

First considering the citations, this figure estimates ``sunpys``'s usage in solar physics research by its yearly publication impact, using citations drawn from the NASA ADS database.
The continual growth in citations shows the broad and increasing usage of ``sunpy`` in solar physics and scientific research, as well as the high impact that contributions to ``sunpy`` can have.

|Citation figure|

To next visualize the size of the developer community contributing to the ``sunpy`` core library, this figure shows the number of people authoring commits over time.
While each year ``sunpy`` is cited more in papers, the amount of developers and especially those contributing multiple times is modest and largely static.

|Commits figure|

The workload to maintain ``sunpy`` can be traced through the number of issues and pull requests open and closed in the ``sunpy`` core library over time.
The long-term increase in overall pull requests, along with a comparable amount of opens and closes on average, shows that the small number of maintainers is increasingly taxed.
The discrepancy between issue opens and closes over time reinforces this.

|Issue PR history figure|

In short, ``sunpy`` would greatly benefit from more developers, whose contributions would reach a significant fraction of research in astronomy.
This figure shows the number of open issues and pull requests for each subpackage in ``sunpy``.
In addition to indicating which functionalities are used more heavily by the community at present, it gives a sense of where you could start if you're interested in contributing to ``sunpy``.
