Installation

If you are new to Python and scientific Python then see the :ref:`main-install` section to get setup with the whole environment.
If you already have a working Python / Scientific Python environment then you can skip to the :ref:`advanced-install` section.

Requirements
============

- python >= 3.7
- astropy >= 3.2

sunpy is compatible with Python 3.7+.

.. _main-install:

Installing Scientific Python and sunpy
======================================

sunpy is part of the wider ecosystem of scientific Python packages for solar physics.
Therefore a working sunpy installation is more about installing the scientific Python ecosystem than sunpy itself.

If you do not currently have a working scientific Python distribution this guide will set you up with the Miniconda, which makes it easy to install and manage your scientific Python packages.
Other options are listed later in the :ref:`advanced-install` section.

To install the Miniconda Python distribution follow the instructions at
`here <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`__.
Although Miniconda makes it simple to switch between Python versions, we recommend that new users install
the latest Python 3.x version of Miniconda as SunPy only supports Python 3.7+.

The reason we choose Miniconda over Anaconda, is mainly due to the size as Anaconda comes with a full install of packages you probably do not need and this way you have more direct control over what has been installed into your Python virtual environment.
Furthermore, you bypass the need for the conda resolver to sort out your root environment which should make "conda" faster to use.

Installing sunpy using Miniconda
--------------------------------

To install SunPy launch a system command prompt or the 'Anaconda Prompt' (under Windows).
First configure conda for sunpy downloads::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --set channel_priority strict

to install sunpy::

    conda install sunpy

You now have a working sunpy installation.
You can check your sunpy install by following the instructions in :ref:`testing-sunpy`.

Updating sunpy
--------------

You can update to the latest version by running::

    conda update sunpy

Advanced sunpy Installation
===========================

If you do not wish to use Miniconda to install Scientific Python or you already have a scientific Python
installation there are other options for installing SunPy:
