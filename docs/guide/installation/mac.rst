Mac OS X

Overview
--------

.. warning::
    We highly recommend that users use the Anaconda python distribution.
    Instructions are available here :ref:`anaconda_install`.

Because of the wide variety of methods for setting up a Python environment on
Mac OS X, users have a number of options with how to install SunPy and its
dependencies. We have a number of solutions listed below. Choose the solution which best
suits you.

For users who wish to have more control over the installation of Python, several
alternative installation methods are provided below, including instructions for
`Macports <http://www.macports.org/>`_ and `Homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_.
The following instructions are not recommended for beginners. OS X comes pre-loaded with
Python but each versions of OS X (Mountain Lion, Snow Leopard, etc.) ships with a
different version of Python. In the instructions below, we therefore recommend that you
install your own version of Python. You will then have two versions of Python living on
your system at the same time. It can be confusing to make sure that when you install
packages they are installed for the correct Python so beware.

Python 2.7.3+
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Download and install the latest version of
`32 bit Python 2.7.3 <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/>`
using their DMG installer. Next, choose your package installer of choice (either
Macports or Homebrew) and follow the instructions below. If you do not have either
go to their respective websites and install one of the other as needed.

.. _xcode:

XCode tools / Compiler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are using MacOS X, you will need to the XCode command line
tools.  One way to get them is to install `XCode
<https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`__. If you are using OS X 10.7
(Lion) or later, you must also explicitly install the command line
tools. You can do this by opening the XCode application, going to
**Preferences**, then **Downloads**, and then under **Components**,
click on the Install button to the right of **Command Line Tools**.
Alternatively, on 10.7 (Lion) or later, you do not need to install
XCode, you can download just the command line tools from
https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action (requires an Apple
developer account).

Homebrew
^^^^^^^^

`Homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_ is a tool for helping to automate
the installation of a number of useful tools and libraries on Mac OS X. It is
similar to Macports, but attempts to improve on some of the pitfalls of
Macports.

Note that if you have already installed either fink or Macports on your system,
it is recommended that you uninstall them before using Homebrew.

Next, install and update homebrew: ::

 /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)"
 brew doctor

Using homebrew, install Qt and some of the other dependencies needed for
compilation later on by pip: ::

 brew -v install gfortran pkgconfig git openjpeg readline pyqt

Now on to the next steps.

Git
^^^
Head over and `download <http://git-scm.com/downloads>` and install git.

Pip
^^^
Most Python distributions ship with a tool called
`easy_install <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_
which assists with installing Python packages.

Although `easy_install`_ is capable of installing most of
the dependencies needed for SunPy itself, a more powerful tool called
`pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__ which provides a more flexible installation
(including support for uninstalling, upgrading, and installing from remote
sources such as GitHub) and should be used instead.

Use `easy_install`_ to install `pip`: ::

    sudo easy_install pip

You are now ready to install scipy, numpy, and matplotlib.

Scientific Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If pip installed properly, then you can install NumPy simply with: ::

    pip install numpy

Now under Lion, install the stable version of SciPy (0.10) by running: ::

    pip install scipy

Mountain Lion users will need to install the development version of SciPy (0.11)
by executing the following line: ::

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/scipy/scipy#egg=scipy-dev

Now on to matplotlib

On Lion, install matplotlib like any other package: ::

    pip install matplotlib

Mountain Lion users will have to use the development version as of this writing: ::

    pip install git+https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git#egg=matplotlib-dev

Done! You are now ready to :doc:`install SunPy itself <index>`.
