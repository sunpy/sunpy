Guides

These guides provide a set of in-depth explanations for various parts of the ``sunpy`` core package.
They assumes you have some knowledge of what ``sunpy`` is and how it works - if you're starting fresh you might want to check out the :ref:`tutorial` first.

How to use the guides
---------------------
The guides are designed to be read in a standalone manner, without running code at the same time.
Although there are code snippets in various bits of the guides, these are to help explanation, and are not structured in a way that they can be run as you're reading each guide.
