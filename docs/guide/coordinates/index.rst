Coordinates
***********

The `sunpy.coordinates` sub-package contains:

* A robust framework for working with solar-physics coordinate systems
* Functions to obtain the locations of solar-system bodies (`sunpy.coordinates.ephemeris`)
* Functions to calculate Sun-specific coordinate information (`sunpy.coordinates.sun`)

The SunPy coordinate framework extends the
:ref:`Astropy coordinates framework <astropy:astropy-coordinates>`.

This page contains an overview of how coordinates work in sunpy.

Design of the Coordinates Sub-Package
=====================================

This sub-package works by defining a collection of ``Frames``
(`sunpy.coordinates.frames`), which exists on a transformation graph, where the
transformations between the coordinate frames are then defined and registered
with the transformation graph (`sunpy.coordinates`). It is also
possible to transform SunPy frames to Astropy frames.

Positions within these ``Frames`` are stored as a ``Representation`` of a
coordinate, a representation being a description of a point in a Cartesian,
spherical or cylindrical system (see :ref:`astropy-coordinates-representations`). A frame
that contains a representation of one or many points is said to have been
'realized'.

For a more in depth look at the design and concepts of the Astropy coordinates
system see :ref:`astropy-coordinates-overview`



Frames and SkyCoord
-------------------

The `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` class is a high level wrapper around the
`astropy.coordinates` sub-package. It provides an easier way to create and transform
coordinates, by using string representations for frames rather than the classes
themselves and some other usability improvements, for more information see the
`~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` documentation.

The main advantage provided by `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` is the support it
provides for caching Frame attributes. Frame attributes are extra data specified
with a frame, some examples in `sunpy.coordinates` are ``obstime`` or
``observer`` for observer location. Only the frames where this data is
meaningful have these attributes, i.e. only the Helioprojective frames have
``observer``. However, when you transform into another frame and then back to a
projective frame using `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` it will remember the attributes previously
provided, and repopulate the final frame with them. If you were to do
transformations using the Frames alone this would not happen.
