Spectrograms
------------
SunPy currently supports reading dynamic spectra from e-Callisto_ instruments.
The main class that is used for this is
:py:class:`CallistoSpectrogram <sunpy.spectra.sources.callisto.CallistoSpectrogram>`. SunPy also
comes with an example image that shows a radio burst observed at `Rosse Observatory`_ (aka. BIR; Birr Castle, Co. Offaly, Ireland) that
can be found in sunpy.data.sample.CALLISTO_SPECTRUM.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import sunpy.spectra
    import sunpy.data.sample
    from sunpy.spectra.sources.callisto import CallistoSpectrogram
    image = CallistoSpectrogram.read(sunpy.data.sample.CALLISTO_SPECTRUM)
    image.peek()

We now notice that there seems to be something interesting that has been
cut off at the corner of the image, so we use the extend method to request
more data from the server. It optionally takes the amount of minutes we want
to request from the server (negative values mean we want to add data that was
registered before our existing local data), if none are given it defaults to
15 minutes (the size of one e-Callisto file). ::

    more = image.extend()
    more.peek()

We will, for the purposes of this demonstration, continue working with the
original image, though.

You can then perform automatic constant background subtraction by using the
:py:meth:`subtract_bg() <sunpy.spectra.spectrogram.Spectrogram.subtract_bg>`
method. The resulting image will be clipped at 0 using the `min` parameter of
peek in order to avoid negative values.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    import sunpy
    import sunpy.data.sample
    from sunpy.spectra.sources.callisto import CallistoSpectrogram
    image = CallistoSpectrogram.read(sunpy.data.sample.CALLISTO_SPECTRUM)
    nobg = image.subtract_bg()
    nobg.peek(vmin=0)

If you want to see the background determined by the automatic subtraction,
you can use the
:py:meth:`auto_const_bg() <sunpy.spectra.spectrogram.Spectrogram.auto_const_bg>`
method and visualize the resulting
data using :py:func:`pyplot.plot`.::

    plt.figure()
    bg = image.auto_const_bg()
    plt.plot(image.freq_axis, bg)
    plt.xlabel("Frequency [MHz]")
    plt.ylabel("Intensity")
    plt.show()

Now let us say we want to isolate the interesting bit (which starts around
10:38) from the boring background; there is a method called
:py:meth:`in_interval() <sunpy.spectra.spectrogram.LinearTimeSpectrogram.in_interval>`
that allows us to take the part of an image that is
within a specified interval. Leaving out the second argument it defaults
to the end time of the file.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import sunpy
    import sunpy.data.sample
    from sunpy.spectra.sources.callisto import CallistoSpectrogram
    image = CallistoSpectrogram.read(sunpy.data.sample.CALLISTO_SPECTRUM)
    nobg = image.subtract_bg()
    interesting = nobg.in_interval("06:27")
    interesting.peek(vmin=0)

To get rid of the noise, we could also clip low intensities by setting vmin.

.. plot::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import sunpy
    import sunpy.data.sample
    from sunpy.spectra.sources.callisto import CallistoSpectrogram
    image = CallistoSpectrogram.read(sunpy.data.sample.CALLISTO_SPECTRUM)
    nobg = image.subtract_bg()
    interesting = nobg.in_interval("06:27")
    interesting.peek(vmin=20)

If we want more context, we can also join together different images into
a large one in time (note that this does more than just concatenating the
array and the axes -- it also considers possible overlap or gaps).::

    c1 = CallistoSpectrogram.read('BIR_20110922_101500_01.fit')
    c2 = CallistoSpectrogram.read('BIR_20110922_103000_01.fit')
    d = CallistoSpectrogram.join_many([c1, c2])

We could also get the from_range method to get data between those two points
directly from the archive and joined together (though that will fetch all
frequencies of BIR): ::

    from sunpy.spectra.sources.callisto import CallistoSpectrogram
    d = CallistoSpectrogram.from_range('BIR', '2011-09-22 10:15:00', '2011-09-22 10:45:00')
