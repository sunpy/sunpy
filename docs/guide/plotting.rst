Plotting in SunPy
-----------------

SunPy makes use of `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ for all of its
plotting - as such, it tries to follow the matplotlib plotting philosophy. It is
therefore useful to go over how matplotlib works as background.

1. Matplotlib Tutorial
----------------------

The tutorial provided here is a summary of one that can be found in the `matplotlib
usage documentation <http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html>`_.

Matplotlib provides two main pathways for plotting. One is meant for interactive use
(e.g. command-line) and the other for non-interactive use (e.g. modules). It is important
to recognize though that the interactive-use pathway (referred to as pyplot) just
provides shortcuts for doing many of the more advanced non-interactive functions in the
background. It is therefore possible to switch between the two as necessary and
it is possible to use pyplot in a non-interactive way. In this manner pyplot
is just a shortcut to making it quicker to set up plot axes and figures.
In order to get access to the full interactive capabilities of pyplot it is
necessary to turn this feature on.
Pylab is another matplotlib usage scenario but it is essentially just pyplot with the
interactive capabilities turned on and numpy and matplotlib imported into the main
namespace.

2. Pyplot
---------
Here is a simple example of pyplot usage.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot(range(10), range(10))
    plt.title("A simple Plot")
    plt.show()

The `~matplotlib.pyplot.show` command opens a plot on the screen and blocks
execution until the plot window is closed. The `~matplotlib.pyplot.show`
command only works once. If you were to call `~matplotlib.pyplot.show` again
after the above code is executed nothing happens. This confusing behavior
is something that the matplotlib devs get complaints about often and so this may change.
A discussion about this can be found `here
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5524858/matplotlib-show-doesnt-work-twice>`_.
Don't be confused by another command called `~matplotlib.pyplot.draw`.
This is only used while in interactive mode.

To turn on interactivity for pyplot use the command ::

    >>> plt.ion()   # doctest: +SKIP

In interactive mode, the plot will appear at the first `~matplotlib.pyplot.plot`
command and most commands will update the plot as you call them. Here is some
example code::

    >>> plt.plot(range(10), range(10))   # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plt.title("Simple Plot")   # doctest: +SKIP

In this example, you'll see that the title appears right on the plot when you call it.
Note that in this case the `~matplotlib.pyplot.show` command is useless as the
plot shows up right when you create it. Also note that some commands will not
automatically update the plot and you have to use the `~matplotlib.pyplot.draw`
command. The following command ::

    >>> plt.ioff()   # doctest: +SKIP

turns off interactivity.

3. Advanced Pyplot
------------------
If you need more fine-grained control over plots the recommended path is to use pyplot
and access the figures and axes objects. This is shown in the following example.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    x = np.arange(0, 10, 0.2)
    y = np.sin(x)
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = plt.subplot()
    ax.plot(x, y)
    ax.set_xlabel('x')
    plt.show()

In matplotlib, `~matplotlib.figure.Figure` is the top-level container for all plot elements and
`~matplotlib.axes.Axes` is the top-level container for a particular plot. So the above example,
creates a figure then creates an axes and populates the plot in ``ax``. With this method you
now have your hands on the `~matplotlib.axes.Axes` object so you can do things
like change the labels on the x and y axes or add a legend.
In the previous section, pyplot took care of creating these
objects for you so you didn't have to worry about creating them yourself.

4. SunPy Plotting Convention
----------------------------

To be consistent with matplotlib, SunPy has developed a standard plotting policy
which supports both simple and advanced matplotlib usage. The following examples
focus on the map object but they should be applicable across all of the data
objects.

4.1 peek()
----------

For quick and easy access to a plot all SunPy base objects (i.e. maps, spectra,
timeseries) define their own `~sunpy.map.mapbase.GenericMap.peek` command which
will create a plot for you and show it without you having to deal with any
matplotlib setup. This is so that it is easy to take a quick look at your data.
For example you can make the following plot.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import sunpy.map
    import sunpy.data.sample
    smap = sunpy.map.Map(sunpy.data.sample.AIA_171_IMAGE)
    smap.peek(draw_limb=True)

This creates a plot window with all axes defined, a plot title, and the image of
the map data defined by the contents of the map. In non-interactive mode the
plot window blocks the command line terminal and must be closed before doing anything else.

4.2 plot()
----------

For more advanced plotting the base SunPy objects also provide a
`~sunpy.map.mapbase.GenericMap.plot` command. This command is similar to the
pyplot `~matplotlib.pyplot.imshow` command in that it will create a figure and
axes object for you if you haven't already.

When you create a plot with `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.peek` or
`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.plot`, SunPy will use `astropy.visualization.wcsaxes` to
represent coordinates on the image accurately, for more information see
:ref:`wcsaxes-plotting`.

Using `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.plot` it is possible to customise the look of the
plot by combining SunPy and matplotlib commands, for example you can over plot
contours on the Map:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import astropy.units as u

    import sunpy.map
    import sunpy.data.sample

    aia_map = sunpy.map.Map(sunpy.data.sample.AIA_171_IMAGE)
    aia_map.plot()
    aia_map.draw_limb()

    # let's add contours as well
    aia_map.draw_contours([10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90] * u.percent)

    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()


In this example, the `~matplotlib.figure.Figure` and
`~astropy.visualization.wcsaxes.WCSAxes` instances are created explicitly, and
then used to modify the plot:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import astropy.units as u
    from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord

    import sunpy.map
    import sunpy.data.sample

    smap = sunpy.map.Map(sunpy.data.sample.AIA_171_IMAGE)

    fig = plt.figure()
    # Provide the Map as a projection, which creates a WCSAxes object
    ax = plt.subplot(projection=smap)

    im = smap.plot()

    # Prevent the image from being re-scaled while overplotting.
    ax.set_autoscale_on(False)

    xc = [0,100,1000] * u.arcsec
    yc = [0,100,1000] * u.arcsec

    coords = SkyCoord(xc, yc, frame=smap.coordinate_frame)

    p = ax.plot_coord(coords, 'o')

    # Set title.
    ax.set_title('Custom plot with WCSAxes')

    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()

It is possible to create the same plot, explicitly not using
`~astropy.visualization.wcsaxes`, however, this will not have the features of
`~astropy.visualization.wcsaxes` which include correct representation of
rotation and plotting in different coordinate systems.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import astropy.units as u

    import sunpy.map
    import sunpy.data.sample

    smap = sunpy.map.Map(sunpy.data.sample.AIA_171_IMAGE)

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()

    im = smap.plot()

    # Prevent the image from being re-scaled while overplotting.
    ax.set_autoscale_on(False)

    xc = [0,100,1000] * u.arcsec
    yc = [0,100,1000] * u.arcsec

    p = plt.plot(xc, yc, 'o')

    # Set title.
    ax.set_title('Custom plot without WCSAxes')

    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()


.. _wcsaxes-plotting:

Plotting Maps with wcsaxes
--------------------------

By default :ref:`map` uses the `astropy.visualization.wcsaxes` module to improve
the representation of world coordinates, and calling
`~sunpy.map.GenericMap.plot` or `~sunpy.map.GenericMap.peek()` will use wcsaxes
for plotting. Unless a standard `matplotlib.axes.Axes` object is explicitly
created.

To explicitly create a `~astropy.visualization.wcsaxes.WCSAxes` instance do the
following ::

    >>> fig = plt.figure()   # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax = plt.subplot(projection=smap)   # doctest: +SKIP

when plotting on an `~astropy.visualization.wcsaxes.WCSAxes` axes, it will by
default plot in pixel coordinates, you can override this behavior and plot in
'world' coordinates by getting the transformation from the axes with
``ax.get_transform('world')``. Note: World coordinates are always in **degrees**
so you will have to convert to degrees.::

    >>> smap.plot()   # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax.plot((100*u.arcsec).to(u.deg), (500*u.arcsec).to(u.deg),
    ...         transform=ax.get_transform('world'))   # doctest: +SKIP

Finally, here is a more complex example using SunPy maps, wcsaxes and Astropy
units to plot a AIA image and a zoomed in view of an active region.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib import patches
    import astropy.units as u
    from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord

    import sunpy.map
    import sunpy.data.sample


    # Define a region of interest
    length = 250 * u.arcsec
    x0 = -100 * u.arcsec
    y0 = -400 * u.arcsec

    # Create a SunPy Map, and a second submap over the region of interest.
    smap = sunpy.map.Map(sunpy.data.sample.AIA_171_IMAGE)
    bottom_left = SkyCoord(x0 - length, y0 - length,
                           frame=smap.coordinate_frame)
    top_right = SkyCoord(x0 + length, y0 + length,
                         frame=smap.coordinate_frame)
    submap = smap.submap(bottom_left, top_right)


    # Create a new matplotlib figure, larger than default.
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5,12))

    # Add a first Axis, using the WCS from the map.
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(2,1,1, projection=smap)

    # Plot the Map on the axes with default settings.
    smap.plot()

    # Draw a box on the image
    smap.draw_rectangle(bottom_left, length * 2, length * 2)

    # Create a second axis on the plot.
    ax2 = fig.add_subplot(2,1,2, projection=submap)

    submap.plot()

    # Add a overlay grid.
    submap.draw_grid(grid_spacing=10*u.deg)

    # Change the title.
    ax2.set_title('Zoomed View')


    plt.show()
