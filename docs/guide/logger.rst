Logging system

Overview
========

The SunPy logging system makes use of the `~astropy.logger.AstropyLogger`.
Its purpose is to provide users the ability to decide which log and warning messages to show,
to capture them, and to send them to a file.

All messages provided by SunPy use this logging facility which is based
on the Python `logging` module rather than print statements.

Messages can have one of several levels

* DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing
  problems.

* INFO: A message conveying information about the current task, and
  confirming that things are working as expected

* WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, and that user
  action may be required.

* ERROR: indicates a more serious issue where something failed but the task is continuing

* CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

By default, only WARNING, ERROR, and ERROR messages are displayed.

The logger
==========
The logger is configured as soon as sunpy is imported. You can access it
by importing it explicitly::

    >>> from sunpy import log

or also by::

    >>> import logging
    >>> log = logging.getLogger('sunpy')

You can use it to issue your own messages or to change its defaults. If you'd like to
capture messages as they are generated you can do that with a context manager::

    >>> from sunpy import log
    >>> with log.log_to_list() as log_list:  #doctest: +SKIP
    ...    # your code here  # doctest: +SKIP

Once your code is executed, ``log_list`` will be a Python list containing all of the Sunpy
messages during execution. This does not divert the messages from going to a file or to the screen.
It is also possible to send the messages to a custom file with::

    >>> from sunpy import log
    >>> with log.log_to_file('myfile.log'):  #doctest: +SKIP
    ...     # your code here  #doctest: +SKIP

which will save the messages to a local file called ``myfile.log``.

User Configuration
==================
Options for the logger can be set in the ``[logger]`` section
of the Sunpy configuration file (:doc:`sunpyrc </guide/customization>`).
