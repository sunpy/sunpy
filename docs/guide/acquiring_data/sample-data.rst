Downloading Sample Data
-----------------------

SunPy provides a number of sample data files which are referenced in the
documentation and examples. These files are available to download onto your
local machine so that you can try out the code in the documentation. To
download the sample data simply run the following command::

    import sunpy.data.sample

This will download the data to your sample-data directory which can be
customized by editing the sunpyrc file (see :doc:`../customization`).
After running this you can then import the sample data files shortcuts which
are used below.
