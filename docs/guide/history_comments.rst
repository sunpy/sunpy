How "HISTORY" and "COMMENT" FITS Keys are Handled in sunpy
**********************************************************

In FITS files, there are often multiple entries for both the ``HISTORY`` and ``COMMENT`` keys.
For example, when applying a prep routine to an image, a ``HISTORY`` entry may be added to the FITS header for every step in the prep pipeline.
Because the metadata associated with each `~sunpy.map.GenericMap` acts like a dictionary, where each key must be unique, these repeated ``HISTORY`` and ``COMMENT`` keys cannot be represented as separate entries in `~sunpy.util.MetaDict`.
Thus, when a FITS file with multiple ``HISTORY`` keys is read into a Map object, all the values corresponding to ``HISTORY`` are joined together with newline characters ``\n`` and stored as a single ``history`` entry in `~sunpy.util.MetaDict`.
When writing the resulting Map to a FITS file, ``history`` is split along the ``\n`` characters and each entry is written to a separate ``HISTORY`` key in the resulting FITS header.
The same is true for ``COMMENT`` keys.
