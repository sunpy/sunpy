.. _customizing-with-sunpyrc-files:

The :file:`sunpyrc` file
=============================

Sunpy uses a :file:`sunpyrc` configuration file to customize certain
properties. You can control a number of key features of SunPy such as
where your data will download to. SunPy looks for :file:`sunpyrc` in two
locations, in the following order:

1. :file:`.sunpy/sunpyrc`, for the user's default customizations.
2. :file:`{INSTALL}/sunpy/data/sunpyrc`. You can find where SunPy is installed
   by printing out `sunpy.__file__` after importing SunPy.

To display where the currently active :file:`sunpyrc` file was loaded from,
one can do the following::

  >>> import sunpy
  >>> sunpy.print_config()   # doctest: +SKIP

To maintain your own customizations place a copy of the default sunpyrc file
into :file:`.sunpy`. Do not edit the default file directly as every
time you install or update SunPy, this file will be overwritten.

See below for the example config file.

.. _customizing-with-dynamic-settings:

Dynamic settings
===================

You can also dynamically change the default settings in a python script or
interactively from the python shell. All of the settings are stored in a
Python ConfigParser instance called :data:`sunpy.config`, which is global to
the sunpy package. Settings can be modified directly, for example::

    import sunpy
    sunpy.config.set('downloads', 'download_dir', '/home/user/Downloads')
