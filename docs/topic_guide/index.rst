Topic Guides
************

These topic guides provide a set of in-depth explanations for various parts of the ``sunpy`` core package.
They assumes you have some knowledge of what ``sunpy`` is and how it works - if you're starting fresh you might want to check out the :ref:`tutorial` first.

**How to use the topic guides**

The topic guides are designed to be read in a standalone manner, without running code at the same time.
Although there are code snippets in various parts of each topic guide, these are present to help explanation, and are not structured in a way that they can be run as you are reading a topic guide.
