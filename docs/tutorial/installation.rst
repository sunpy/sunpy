This is the first chapter in the sunpy tutorial, and by the end of it you should have a working installation of Python and ``sunpy``.
For more info on different ways to install ``sunpy`` beyond the recommended way below, see :ref:`guide_installing`.

Installing Python
=================
There are many ways to install Python, but even if you have Python installed somewhere on your computer we recommend following these instructions anyway.
That's because we will create a new Python environment.
As well as containing a Python installation, this environment provides an isolated place to install Python packages (like ``sunpy``) without affecting any other current Python installation.

The package manager we'll be using is called ``conda``.
To install conda, follow the `the miniforge installation instructions <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#install>`__.
This will install ``conda`` and automatically configure the default channel (a channel is a remote software repository) to be ``conda-forge``, which is where ``sunpy`` is available.

Installing sunpy
----------------
To install ``sunpy``, start by launching a terminal (under a UNIX-like system) or the miniforge Prompt (under Windows).
Then create and activate new virtual environment

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda create --name sunpy
    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
    $ conda config --set channel_priority strict
    $ conda activate sunpy

In this case the environment is named 'sunpy'.
Feel free to change this to a different environment name.
Now we have a fresh environment we can install ``sunpy``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install sunpy

This will install ``sunpy`` and all of its dependencies.
If you want to install another package later, you can run ``conda install <package_name>``.

Now we've got a working installation of ``sunpy``, in the next few chapters we'll look at some of the basic data structures ``sunpy`` uses for representing times, coordinates, and data with physical units.
