SunPy currently does not yet have support for a standard installation.
Support should be added at the time of our first official release (v0.1).

In the mean time you can test SunPy by simply downloading the code (which you
probably already have if you are reading this) and then importing the module.

Example Usage:

>>> import sunpy
>>> import matplotlib.cm as cm
>>> import matplotlib.colors as colors
>>> map = sunpy.Map('sunpy/dev/sample-data/AIA20110319_105400_0171.fits')
>>> map.header['crpix1']
>>> map.plot(cm=cm.hot, norm=colors.Normalize(1, 2048))
