All of the SunPy documentation is contained in the doc/source folder and code
comments. To generate the documentation you must have Sphinx (as well as
Numpydoc and astropy-helpers) installed on your computer. Enter
the doc/source folder and run:

  make html

This will generate HTML documentation for SunPy. To clean up and delete the
generated documentation run:

  make clean

For more information on how to use Sphinx, consult the Sphinx documentation.
