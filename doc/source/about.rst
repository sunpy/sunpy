The SunPy project is an effort to create an open-source software library for 
solar physics using the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ programming language.

Currently the project is in the very early stages of development and planning, 
and is not ready yet to be used in day-to-day software development. If you like 
to get involved with the effort considering joining the `SunPy mailing list 
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy>`_ or `downloading the latest 
source-code <https://code.launchpad.net/sunpy>`_ from Launchpad.
