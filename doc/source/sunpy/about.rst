The SunPy project is an effort to create an open-source software library for 
solar physics using the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ programming language.

Currently the project is in the early stages of development and planning. If you like 
to get involved with the effort considering joining the `SunPy mailing list 
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy>`_ or `downloading the latest 
source-code <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy>`_ from GitHub.
