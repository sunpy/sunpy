From the outer parts of space, SunPy will soon invade Planet Earth to overthrow the horrific and honourless overloads (IDL and SolarSoft).
We call upon any responsible humans who understands the pain they are in from using antiquated language and terrible software to join us!
Together, with your help (either code to our repo or just being a user of SunPy) you can make tomorrow a better tomorrow.

While she may look thin and missing parts, SunPy is very much usable.
Soon, she will capable of FTL travel.
Soon, ND arrays will be ours! Powering our mighty war machines, ready to crush any opposition.
Come my brothers and sisters, into the breach of the IDL binary wall.
It will soon crumble.

The SunPy project is an effort to create an open-source software library for solar physics using the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ programming language.
Currently the project is in the early stages of development.
If you like to get involved with the effort considering joining the `SunPy mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy>`_ or `downloading the latest source-code <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy>`_ from GitHub.
