Lightcurves
===========

Time series data are a fundamental part of many data analysis projects as much in
heliophysics as other areas. SunPy therefore provides a lightcurve object to
handle this type of data. Once you've read through this guide check out
the :doc:`/code_ref/lightcurve` for a more thorough look at SunPy LightCurve
and to see what data sources it currently supports.

1. Creating a Lightcurve from a data source
-------------------------------------------

To create a `~sunpy.lightcurve.LightCurve` object from one of the supported data sources,
import the object into your session.  Unlike the `~sunpy.map.GenericMap`
object and its instrument-specific subclasses, the instrument sub-classes
of `~sunpy.lightcurve.LightCurve` provide a way to download their own data on
creating. The following example creates a `~sunpy.lightcurve.GOESLightCurve`
for the specified time range: ::

    >>> from sunpy.lightcurve import GOESLightCurve
    >>> from sunpy.time import TimeRange
    >>> tr = TimeRange('2013/07/21', '2013/07/22')
    >>> goes = GOESLightCurve.create(tr)

The `~sunpy.lightcurve.GOESLightCurve` will go off and download the data that is
needed and therefore requires an internet connection.

2. Creating Custom Lightcurve
-----------------------------
It is also very easy to create lightcurves using custom data.

    >>> from sunpy.lightcurve import LightCurve
    >>> light_curve = LightCurve.create({"param1": range(24*60)})

Within `~sunpy.lightcurve.LightCurve.create`, we have a dictionary that contains a single entry with key
``param1`` containing a list of 1440 entries (0-1439). As there are no times provided,
so a default set of times are generated.

A LightCurve object must be supplied with some data when it is
created.  The data can either be in your current Python session, in a
local file, or in a remote file.  Let's create some fake data and pass
it into a LightCurve object: ::

    >>> from sunpy.lightcurve import LightCurve
    >>> light_curve = LightCurve.create({"param1": range(24 * 60)})

The first line imports the lightcurve object.  Let's look at the
argument in LightCurve.create.  The argument is a dictionary that
contains a single entry with key "param1" with a value of a list of
1440 entries (from 0 to 1439) - these are our 'fake data'
measurements.  Since no other times are provided, a default set of
times are provided.  You can provide your own times very simply using
the 'index' keyword, as is shown below: ::

    >>> import datetime
    >>> base = datetime.datetime.today()
    >>> dates = [base - datetime.timedelta(minutes=x) for x in range(0, 24 * 60)]
    >>> light_curve = LightCurve.create({"param1": range(24 * 60)}, index=dates)

This gives the measurements "param1" a set of times, in this case,
1440 minutes beginning at the current local time.  Under the hood,
this has created a pandas `~pandas.DataFrame` object with a column name "param1",
with an index of times.

3. Inspecting maps & Getting at the data
----------------------------------------
A lightcurve holds both data as well as meta data. The meta data for the lightcurve
 is accessed by ::

    >>> header = goes.meta

This references the meta data dictionary with the header information as read
from the source file. A word of caution, many data sources provide little to no
meta data so this variable might be empty.

The data in a SunPy `~sunpy.lightcurve.LightCurve` object is accessible through the
`~sunpy.map.LightCurve.data` attribute.  The data is implemented as a
Pandas `~pandas.DataFrame`, so to get a look at what data you have available ::

    >>> goes.data

You can also get a quick overview of what data you have available like so: ::

    >>> goes.data.info()

LightCurves are columnar data so to get at a particular datum you need to
first index the column then the element you want. To get the names of the
available columns: ::

    >>> goes.data.columns

So you can access the 0th element in the column `xrsa` with: ::

    >>> goes.data['xrsa'][0]

You can also grab all of the data at a particular time: ::

    >>> goes.data['xrsa']['2013-07-21 23:59']

This will return a list of entries with times that match the accuracy of the time
you provide. Finally if you want to get at the x or y values: ::

    >>> x = goes.data.index
    >>> y = goes.data.values

You can read more about indexing at the `pandas documentation website
<http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/>`_.

3. Plotting
-------------------------------------

The SunPy LightCurve object has its own built-in plot methods so that
it is easy to quickly view your lightcurve. To create a plot just
type:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    from sunpy.lightcurve import GOESLightCurve
    from sunpy.data.sample import GOES_LIGHTCURVE
    goes = GOESLightCurve.create(GOES_LIGHTCURVE)
    goes.peek()

This will open a matplotlib plot on your screen. The `~sunpy.lightcurve.LightCurve.peek()`
function provides a custom view on the data while `~sunpy.lightcurve.LightCurve.plot()`
provides a more generic plot.

In addition, to enable users to modify the plot it is possible to grab the
matplotlib axes object by using the `~sunpy.lightcurve.LightCurve.plot()` command.
This makes it possible to use the SunPy plot as the foundation for a
more complicated figure. For a bit more information about this and some
examples see :ref:`plotting`. Here is one a more complicated example
which makes use of this methodology.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    from sunpy.lightcurve import GOESLightCurve
    from sunpy.data.sample import GOES_LIGHTCURVE
    goes = GOESLightCurve.create(GOES_LIGHTCURVE)
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = goes.plot()
    ax.set_ylim(1e-10, 25e-8)
    ax.set_title('My Plot')
    ax.set_ylabel('Watts')
    plt.show()

Here is another more advanced example. Click the source link to see the that
generated this plot.

.. plot::

    from sunpy.lightcurve import GOESLightCurve
    from sunpy.data.sample import GOES_LIGHTCURVE
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from datetime import datetime
    from astropy.time import Time

    year = 2012
    month = 6
    day = 1
    time_ranges = ((datetime(year,month,day,17,0,0), datetime(year,month,day,18,0,0)),
                   (datetime(year,month,day,19,5,0), datetime(year,month,day,19,50,0)),
                   (datetime(year,month,day,20,20,0), datetime(year,month,day,21,10,0)))

    goes = GOESLightCurve.create(GOES_LIGHTCURVE)

    plt.figure()
    plt.subplot(211)
    ax = goes.data['xrsb'].plot(color='r')
    plt.ylabel(r'1 - 8 $\AA$')
    plt.title(goes.meta.get('TELESCOP'))
    for time_range in time_ranges:
        plt.axvspan(time_range[0], time_range[1], facecolor='gray', alpha=0.5, label='fit')
    ax.set_xticklabels([])
    plt.subplot(212)
    goes.data['xrsa'].plot()
    plt.ylabel(r'0.5 - 4 $\AA$')
    plt.xlabel(goes.data.index[0].to_datetime().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%m') + ' [UT]')
    plt.show()
