============
Installation
============

Below are instructions for installing SunPy and its prerequisites on 
different platforms.

SunPy's Dependancies
--------------------
SunPy consists of many submodules that each have their own requirements. You do not need 
to fufill all the requirements if you only intend on using parts of SunPy. It is of course
reccomended that you install the requirements for all of SunPy.

The Full set of requirements is:
numpy >= 1.6.0
scipy >= 0.10.0
matplotlib >= 1.1
pandas >= 0.10.0
astropy >= 0.2.0
suds
beautifulsoup4

To import SunPy core (including sun, time, util) you need the following dependacies:
numpy
scipy

Any submodules with extra requirements are listed below:
instr:
astropy.io.fits
matplotlib

io:
Optionally either of:
astropy.io.fits
openjpeg

lightcurve:
pandas
astropy.io.fits
matplotlib

map:
astropy.io.fits
matplotlib

net:
suds
beautifulsoup4

visualization:
matplotlib

Installing Scientific Python
----------------------------
For instructions on setting up the scientific Python environment which is required by SunPy, 
choose your OS from the list below. When you are done come back here and follow
the instructions below to install SunPy and its requirements.

   mac
   linux
   win

Anaconda
^^^^^^^^
Alternatively, available for all platforms is Anaconda,
a scientific Python distribution that is available free of charge
from `https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/ <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_.
It comes with a complete build environment so you will not need to worry about
installing a compiler or likewise.

Head to the download page, install it and you are set. It can also be installed
into your user directory without administrator permissions; be sure to use
the Anaconda versions of the commands in the following listings if you have
multiple Python environments installed.

Installing Python Modules
-------------------------

Making sure to have followed one of the guides previously. 
You will have installed on your system: Python, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, git, pip and Qt.
There are few more remaining dependencies which must be installed using pip.
Depending on which system you are using some of these may already be installed but it does not hurt to upgrade: ::

 pip install --upgrade distribute
 pip install --upgrade pyfits
 pip install --upgrade suds
 pip install --upgrade pandas
 pip install --upgrade beautifulsoup4

We also recommend you use `ipython <http://ipython.org/>` (a great python enviromnent). 
This can also be installed using pip: ::

 pip install --upgrade ipython
 
All done with the SunPy Python prerequisites. You are now ready to install SunPy itself.

Installing SunPy
----------------
There are two different versions of SunPy.
Currently, we recommend that users install the latest stable release.
However, the bleeding edge version on our GitHub page is quite easy to install and you do get the latest and greatest but it may have bugs.
Depending on your setup, you may need to preface each of the ``pip ...`` commands with ``sudo pip ...``.

Grabbing the stable SunPy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is as simple as this: ::

    pip install sunpy

If you are upgrading the package: ::

    pip install --upgrade sunpy

For those who like to download the source.
You have a range of download locations.

PyPi: `Download <https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/sunpy/sunpy-0.3.1.tar.gz>`_

Github (tar.gz): `Download <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/tarball/0.3>`_ 

Github (zip): `Download <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/zipball/0.3>`_ 

Then you can use: ::

    pip install ./<path to download>/SunPyDownload.file_extension

In some cases you may need the ``--no-deps`` flag if pip is trying to upgrade dependencies such as SciPy and Matplotlib that are difficult to build from source and the likely errors will abort the upgrade.
That's it folks!

Grabbing the latest SunPy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you do fancy the latest version of SunPy.
Then you will want to cd into directory you want to have SunPy located and now: ::

 git clone git@github.com:sunpy/sunpy.git

or using HTTP: ::

 git clone http://github.com/sunpy/sunpy.git

This will download the SunPy repository and create a sunpy folder at the current location.
With time, updates will happen and you can update your local copy by: ::

 git pull upstream master

Finally, to install or upgrade the local version of SunPy you can run: ::

 python setup.py install --upgrade

Testing your installation
-------------------------

Now you can test your installation. Open a new Python shell and type these 
commands: ::

>>> import sunpy
>>> sunpy.Map(sunpy.AIA_171_IMAGE).peek()

If all goes well you should see an AIA 171 image on your screen.
