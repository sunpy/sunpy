Installation
============

Below are instructions for installing SunPy and its prerequisites on 
different platforms.

Installing Scientific Python
----------------------------
For instructions on setting up the scientific Python environment which is required by SunPy, 
choose your OS from the list below. When you are done come back here and follow
the instructions below to install SunPy and its requirements.

Anaconda
^^^^^^^^
Alternatively, available for all platforms is Anaconda,
a scientific Python distribution that is available free of charge
from `https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/ <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_.
It comes with a complete build environment so you will not need to worry about
installing a compiler or likewise.

Head to the download page, install it and you are set. It can also be installed
into your user directory without administrator permissions; be sure to use
the Anaconda versions of the commands in the following listings if you have
multiple Python environments installed.

Installing Python Modules
-------------------------

Making sure to have followed one of the guides previously. 
You will have installed on your system: Python, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, git, pip and Qt.
There are few more remaining dependencies which must be installed using pip.
Depending on which system you are using some of these may already be installed but it does not hurt to upgrade: ::

 pip install --upgrade distribute
 pip install --upgrade pyfits
 pip install --upgrade suds
 pip install --upgrade pandas
 pip install --upgrade beautifulsoup4

We also recommend you use `ipython <http://ipython.org/>` (a great python enviromnent). 
This can also be installed using pip: ::

 pip install --upgrade ipython
 
All done with the SunPy Python prerequisites. You are now ready to install SunPy itself.

Installing SunPy
----------------
There are two different versions of SunPy.
Currently, we recommend that users install the latest stable release.
However, the bleeding edge version off our GitHub is quite easy to install and you do get the latest and greatest but it may have bugs.
If you do want to do this then check :ref:`contrib-reference-label`.
Depending on your setup, you may need to preface each of the ``pip ...`` commands with ``sudo pip ...``.

Grabbing the stable SunPy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is as simple as this: ::

    pip install sunpy

If you are upgrading the package: ::

    pip install --upgrade sunpy

For those who like to download the source.
You have a range of download locations.

PyPi: `Download <https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/sunpy/sunpy-0.3.0.tar.gz>`_

Github (tar.gz): `Download <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/tarball/0.3>`_ 

Github (zip): `Download <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/zipball/0.3>`_ 

Then you can use: ::

    pip install ./<path to download>/SunPyPackageName.file_extension

In some cases you may need the ``--no-deps`` flag if pip is trying to upgrade dependencies such as SciPy and Matplotlib that are difficult to build from source and the likely errors will abort the upgrade.
That's it folks!

Testing your installation
-------------------------

Now you can test your installation. Open a new Python shell and type these 
commands: ::

>>> import sunpy
>>> sunpy.Map(sunpy.AIA_171_IMAGE).peek()

If all goes well you should see an AIA 171 image on your screen.
