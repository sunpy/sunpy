How to Contribute to SunPy
--------------------------

Thanks for your interest in contributing to SunPy!

SunPy is an open project that encourages everyone to contribute in any way possible.
Although this document mainly focuses on how to make contributions to SunPy code and documentation, there are many other ways to get involved with the SunPy community.
A good place to start is by saying hello in our `matrix`_ chat room or the `mailing list`_.

This is a condensed version from our `Developers Guide`_.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you have found a problem when using SunPy the best way to report it and get some help is by opening an `issue`_ on our GitHub issue tracker.

You will need to sign in to `GitHub`_ to report an issue.
If you are not already a member of Github, you will have to join.
Joining GitHub will also make it easier to report and track issues in the future.

If you do not want to join Github, then another way to report your issue
is email the SunPy developers list `sunpy-dev@googlegroups.com`_.

Issue reports should provide a short description of the issue.
If you are reporting a bug, please post a code sample so others can attempt to reproduce the error.
Please also post any error output generated by the bug.
For a good example of how to do this see issue `#1191`_.

If you are making a feature request, please post as much information as possible regarding the feature you would like to see in SunPy.

Finding Things to Contribute to
-------------------------------

If you want to contribute to SunPy but don’t know where to start, we maintain a list of issues that are good as a starting place, these can be found under the `Package Novice`_ label.

Making a Code or Documentation Contribution
-------------------------------------------

To make a contribution to the SunPy code or documentation you will need to use git and GitHub, which are the tools SunPy uses to manage changes to the code and documentation.

1. Get a `GitHub Account`_
2. `Fork`_ SunPy on GitHub
3. Install the developer version of SunPy using git.
4. Make your changes and push to your fork.
5. Create a `pull request`_.

If any of the above steps are unfamiliar to you check out our `Developers Guide`_.
(Suggesting improvements to the developers guide is an excellent way to contribute!)

Pull Request Review
-------------------

When you submit a pull request it can be reviewed and commented on by anyone.
Everyone’s contributions are reviewed, and no-one’s contributions are accepted in to SunPy without being reviewed.
We do this to try to maintain a consistent coding style and high quality code.

Pull Requests to non-master Branches
------------------------------------

From time to time, large feature development work may occur in branches other than master, and all maintained releases currently have a branch i.e. ``0.8``.
When making a PR to one of these branches (not master), please put the name of the branch in square brackets at the beginning of the PR, i.e. ``[0.8] My bug fix``.
This makes it easier to filter and review these PRs on GitHub.
